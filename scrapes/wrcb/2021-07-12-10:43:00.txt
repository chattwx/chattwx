Tuesday some of the latest model data is suggesting areas of heavy rain during
mainly the morning and afternoon hours. A few of the storms will produce heavy
rain and flooding, lightning, and winds gusting to about 30 mph. Be weather
aware driving around Tuesday. Some areas could get up to 2" of rain under some
of the stronger storms.

Wednesday and Thursday will be dominated by mugginess. Highs will reach 90 with
heat index values in the mid-90s. I expect very little (if any) rain either day.

Friday through the weekend the summer pattern returns with highs in the upper
80s, lots of humidity, and a few storms popping up each afternoon.
