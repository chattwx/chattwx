Today will be partly sunny with highs from 85-89. Most locations will stay dry
today, but we'll have a few afternoon/evening pop-up showers and storms. These
will most likely fire up along area ridgelines. Tonight will be partly cloudy
with lows in the mid-60s.

Friday will be a Storm Alert Weather Day. We'll start off the morning with some
rain showers, nothing severe. Then, our window for potentially strong to severe
storms will be 2-10pm. A line of storms will move west to east with gusty wind,
heavy rain, and possible hail. The timing keeps fluctuating, so please remain
flexible with your outdoor plans or holiday weekend travel schedule. As of now,
the main window looks to be 2-7pm with a weaker secondary batch coming later.
The benefit will be some much needed rain after a hot/dry week at 0.5-1".

Then, much cooler air will follow. Saturday's high will be near 74 with a partly
sunny sky and a 10% chance for a spotty shower. Sunday looks to be fantastic!
Lots of sun with highs around 77. Monday will be partly cloudy with warmer highs
in the low 80s.
