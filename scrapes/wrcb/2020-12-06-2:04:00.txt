Freezing fog is a problem again this morning, especially along area river
valleys. Most of our counties are under an advisory until 10AM EST/9AM CST.
Please, be careful driving with reduced visibility at 1/2 mile or less and the
possibility of frost on bridges and roads. Once the fog mixes out the rest of
the morning and early afternoon will be mostly sunny becoming partly cloudy
later. There's only a 10% chance for a spotty sprinkle, so keep your outdoor
plans. Highs seasonable in the mid-50s. Overnight wind will shift to coming out
of the NW at 5 to 10mph. Lows will be in the mid-30s.

Monday will be a chilly day. Highs will struggle to reach 42-45 with a brisk
northwest breeze and a partly sunny sky. A few flurries will be possible in the
eastern higher elevations, mainly Monroe County. Tuesday will be mostly sunny
with highs near 48. Wednesday and Thursday will have some high thin clouds with
highs in the mid-50s and near 60, respectively. The work week will end with
broken cloud cover and highs around 60 on Friday. Showers will return on
Saturday.
