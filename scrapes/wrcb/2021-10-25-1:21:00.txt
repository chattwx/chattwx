Thankfully, there is no longer a threat for strong to severe storms in our area
today. Showers have really faded out. All that's left are light scattered
showers, which will continue through the afternoon. Clouds will partially clear
with highs from 70-75. A cold front will pass us around 6-7pm ET this evening,
followed by cool overnight lows in the mid to upper 40s. 

Tuesday will be cooler with highs near 65 and decreasing clouds and sunshine.
Wednesday will have a layer of high thin clouds with highs in the upper 60s.
Then, we will enter an unsettled pattern with rain on Thursday and Friday and
much cooler highs in the low 60s and mid-50s, respectively.
