Happy Wednesday, everyone! Get ready for a nice Spring-like day across the
region. Look for partly sunny skies, a southerly breeze, and temps warming into
the 70s for our Wednesday afternoon. Tonight, clouds will be on the increase
which will help keep overnight lows in the upper 40s to low 50s. 

Thursday will feature mostly cloudy skies. A cold front will approach the area
during the day bringing scattered showers through the region. Rainfall amounts
look to remain fairly low in the 0.25 or less range. Highs will be in the 60s.
The front clears the skies by Thursday night, allowing for cold air to rush back
into the area. Overnight lows will likely head back down to near the freezing
mark.

Friday will be a sunny, but chilly day. Morning temps kickoff near freezing,
with daytime highs only in the low to mid 50s.

Saturday will feature mostly sunny skies with a widespread morning freeze,
followed by highs only in the 50s.

As a another front begins to approach the area Sunday, clouds will stream in,
but temps will still warm into the upper 50s to near 60 by the afternoon hours.
The next front brings rain chances back to the area Sunday night into Monday
morning. Rainfall amounts may be in the 0.25-0.50 range. The big deal behind
this front will be the very cold air that looks to follow the rain. In fact on
Monday, high temperatures may happen just after midnight. We will likely see
blustery & colder conditions during the day with temperatures in the 40s. A
potential hard freeze is on tap for the area Monday night with overnight lows
dropping into the 20s. Highs on Tuesday will once again only be in the 40s with
full sunshine.

Brrr!
