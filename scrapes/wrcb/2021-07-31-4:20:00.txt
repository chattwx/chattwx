The last day of July is going to feature plenty of heat and humidity. High
temperatures will range from 90-95 degrees under hazy skies. Heat index values
will likely approach the triple digits during the heat of the day. An isolated
shower or storm will be possible after 5 PM.

Rain chances will increase tonight into Sunday as a disturbance pushes across
the Tennessee Valley. Localized heavy rain and a few rumbles of thunder will be
the primary concern. Temperatures will also be 5-7 degrees cooler on Sunday due
to the increased cloud cover.

This upcoming week will bring welcome relief from the extreme heat. It will
still be quite hot each afternoon with highs ranging from 84-89 degrees, but the
humidity will be much more tolerable. A few storms will be around each afternoon
along with plenty of sunshine for the first week of August!
