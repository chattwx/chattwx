Happy Saturday! It is going to be another hot one across the Tennessee Valley!
High temperatures will top out in the lower-90s under partly cloudy skies. A
stray shower or two will be possible, but most of us stay will stay dry. The
weather will be nearly identical for your Sunday, making for a fantastic weekend
to hit the pool or lake!

The remnants of Hurricane Ida will have implications on our weather heading into
next week. Ida is projected to make landfall in southeastern Louisiana as a
major hurricane late Sunday. Ida will continue an inland trek and remnants will
arrive in the Tennessee Valley early Tuesday morning. Periods of heavy rain
along with breezy winds will likely impact the area Tuesday into Wednesday.
Total rainfall amounts of 2-4" will be possible with higher amounts in our
southwestern communities. We will also be on the lookout for a few strong to
severe storms, especially on Tuesday.

The remnants of Hurricane Ida will be long gone by the end of the week as drier
air filters into the area. Thursday and Friday will feature plenty of sunshine,
lower humidity, and high temperatures only topping out in the mid-80s!

Enjoy your weekend, and don't forget to download the WRCB weather app for the
