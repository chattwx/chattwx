Good Friday! The evening will be a classic fall one with clear skies and cool
crisp air. Temps will fall through the 40s into the upper 30s this evening.

Saturday we start in the low 30s and wind our way up to the upper 50s under
partly cloudy skies.

Sunday will range in temperature from a low of 39 to a pleasant high of 60. Our
next front will bring in rain, heavy at times, to the area after 4pm and moving
out of after midnight. It should be a wet Sunday night. I expect about 1/2" of
rain.

Cold air moves in Monday with temps in the 40s all day. Tuesday will start in
the 20s and climb to the low 50s. Wednesday will start in the upper 20s and make
it to 57.

Thanksgiving Day looks good. It will be cool with temps in the low to mid-30s in
the morning and rebounding to the upper 50s in the afternoon. Black Friday will
also be cool, but pleasant.
