What a difference a day makes! Lingering cloud cover has kept daytime
temperatures in the 40s across the Tennessee Valley. Northerly winds from 10-15
mph will continue this evening, keeping wind chills in the 30s. If you are
heading out, be sure to grab a heavy jacket!

Skies will clear out tonight with temperatures dropping below freezing across
much of the Tennessee Valley. It will finally feel like December!

We will press the pause button on December warmth through the middle of the week
as temperatures remain seasonable. Highs will top out in the 50s each afternoon
with overnight lows dropping into the 30s.

Friday is Christmas Eve, and it looks like it will be a warm one as highs return
to the 60s. Christmas Day will feature high temperatures in the mid-60s with a
mix of sun and clouds. A few showers will be possible, but most of us will
remain dry through the holiday!
