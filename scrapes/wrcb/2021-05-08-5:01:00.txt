It'll remain partly cloudy to mostly cloudy for Saturday evening with a spotty
sprinkle. Both the Lookouts and CFC are playing tonight. It'll be around 69 for
the start of the games, ending in the mid to low 60s. Overnight lows will be
from 49-54 for most locations.

Mother's Day will begin great! Mostly sunny in the morning. No problems for your
Mother's Day brunch with a partly cloudy sky and temperatures near 75 at noon.
Clouds will continue to increase with afternoon highs around 80. It will be
breezy with south wind at 10-15mph, gusts at 20-35mph. Then, scattered
showers/storms will enter our western counties around 4pm/3pm CT. The line will
become more developed with rain and stronger storms from about 8pm to midnight.
During this time, a few isolated severe storms with damaging wind will be
possible. Areas west of I-75 are under a Level 1 Marginal Risk, including
Chattanooga. We're calling it a Storm Alert Weather Day due to the wind and the
potential for trees/tree limbs to come down.

Rain will then continue into Monday morning, but any storms will be weaker. A
few additional hit and miss showers will persist during daylight hours, and
it'll be cooler with highs around 70. Tuesday and Wednesday will have a mix of
sun and clouds with those south experiencing cloudier skies and north more
likely to have some sun. Only an isolated shower chance and highs in the low 70s
and mid-60s, respectively.
