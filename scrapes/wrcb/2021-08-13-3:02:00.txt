Good Friday! After some storms provided heavy downpours of 1"-2+" things have
quieted quite a bit. We may have one or two additional storms sneaking in this
evening, but most of you will enjoy a rain-free Friday night with temps falling
through the mid and low 80s.

Saturday will be another hot and humid one with spotty afternoon storms and a
high of 91.

Sunday we will have a front along with some moisture coming in from what will be
Tropical Storm Fred. I am raising the chance for showers and storms to 60% for
Sunday afternoon and Sunday evening. The high will be a little lower in the
upper 80s.

Monday and Tuesday we will have highs in the mid 80s with the amount of rain we
get determined by the path and strength of Fred as it moves through. Right now I
would expect on and off scattered showers through the day Monday and Tuesday.
Highs will not get past the mid 80s.
