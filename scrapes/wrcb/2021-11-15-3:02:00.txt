Good Monday. We will have a cool, clear evening with temps in the 40s. We will
see temps drop overnight into the mid to upper 30s in the valley and the Blue
Ridge. However, we will be a bit colder on the plateau with lows near 30. Some
areas of frost and fog are possible Tuesday morning.

Tuesday afternoon we will warm quite a bit with mostly cloudy skies and highs in
the mid 60s. Wednesday will get even warmer with a high of 72.

Thursday another cool front will move through bringing some morning rain
showers, and clearing late in the day. Highs will reach the low 60s.

Friday through the weekend the chilly air returns with lows back into the 30s
and highs in the 50s.

A couple of celestial things to look for this week:
-The Leonid Meteor Shower will peak Wednesday night (10-15 per hour), but you
could see some each night through November
-We will have a partial lunar eclipse Friday morning from 2:18 to 5:47. The moon
will be 97.4% obscured
