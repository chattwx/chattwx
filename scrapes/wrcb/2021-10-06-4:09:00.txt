Good morning, today will be a Storm Alert Weather Day. There are 2 weather
concerns.

1. Flooding risk - Flash Flood Watch in place through Thursday morning.

2. Severe storms - Isolated strong to severe storms will be possible today. Our
area is under a Level 1 Marginal risk. The probability is low, but
unfortunately, it's not zero. All severe modes will be possible including
damaging winds, hail, and an isolated tornado.

Like yesterday, showers and storms will be on and off today, so overall, it
won't seem like too bad of a day because you'll have some dry periods. However,
the ingredients will be in place that a few stronger storms may develop. Bands
of heavy rainfall may lead to localized flooding, and again the potential for
isolated severe storms. The main risk window for severe weather will be noon to
9pm ET. We may even see a few breaks in the clouds today and that heating will
provide extra instability to fire up storms. Highs today in the mid-70s. Make
sure you have multiple ways to be notified of a weather warning.

Thursday will again have periods of showers and storms with heavy rainfall,
mostly cloudy, and highs in the mid-70s. Friday will have diminishing rain
chances with clouds slowly decreasing in the afternoon. All leading up to a
wonderful weather weekend with mostly sunny skies and highs around 80.
