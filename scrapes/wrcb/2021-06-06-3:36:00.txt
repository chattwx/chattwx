The light showers and drizzle for areas west of I-75 are fading out this
afternoon and will generally end by evening. Sporadic downpours will continue
for areas east of I-75 though until about 9pm. Then, another batch of rain will
arrive in our southern counties around midnight with showers for the overnight
hours and lows from 65-70.

Monday will be a mostly cloudy to cloudy day with highs in the upper 70s to low
80s. A few pockets of showers will develop in the morning, but mainly we'll be
watching for hit and miss storms in the afternoon. Tuesday will have a few
breaks in the clouds with scattered showers and storms - highs in the low 80s.
Wednesday will be mostly cloudy again, highs near 84, with additional on and off
showers. Thursday will have peeks of sun in between likely periods of showers
and storms - highs near 84. Friday will be similar at 50% and 83 for the high.

Overall, it'll be a humid week with average total rainfall at 1.5-2".
