Good morning, enjoy the quiet and comfortable start to your Monday because our
brief relief from the July heat is gone. Today's highs will reach the low 90s
under a mostly sunny sky. It will be slightly hazy as smoke from Canadian
wildfires has moved as far south as our area. Tonight will be partly cloudy in
the mid-60s to around 70.

Tuesday will remain hot around 90 with a mostly sunny sky and isolated PM
showers/storms. Wednesday will be slightly cooler in the mid-80s with increased
scattered showers and storms. The pattern of daily scattered showers/storms will
continue for Thursday through Sunday.

Tropical Update: Tropical Storm Elsa will have its greatest impacts today on
Cuba, and then Florida will be next.
