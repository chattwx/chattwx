Showers will move across our area from west to east this morning associated with
a cold front. They will arrive in the west around 7-7:30/6-6:30am CT and exit
east around 1-1:30pm ET. There will be 2 narrow bands, during which rain may
briefly be heavy. The second one will be a more consistent line. Total rainfall
will be a Trace to 0.25". It'll also be breezy today with wind gusts up to 30mph
in the valley and 40-50mph in the highest elevations as wind shifts from the
south to eventually the northwest this evening. Once the front passes, clouds
will clear for Sunday afternoon sunshine from west to east. Highs will be in the
mid-60s. Do expect a cool Sunday evening to end your weekend.

The highlights for the work week will be sunshine, dry weather, and cooler
temperatures. Monday and Tuesday will have highs around 60 with morning lows
from 35-40. Wednesday will be cooler with highs in the mid-50s and lows from
freezing to the mid-30s. Thursday will be back up around 60, and then expect
mid-60s for Friday. Next weekend looks to remain dry with some clouds.
