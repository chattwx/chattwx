Any leftover snow showers or flurries will be ending tonight as the low drops

northwest at 15 to 20 mph along with higher gusts. Tuesday will continue breezy
and cold with highs in the low 40's and sunshine returning. Tuesday night will
be clear, breezy, and cold with lows in the mid-'20s.

Wednesday will be partly cloudy and cool with highs in the upper 40's. Thursday
will see clouds increasing and highs in the low 50's. There will be a few
showers developing late Thursday night and into Friday morning. The rain will be
over before Friday afternoon as highs climb into the upper 40's. 

Saturday will be cloudy with some rain-snow mixture developing Saturday night.
Highs will be in the upper 40's. Sunday could be an interesting day as colder
air will approach. Some of the weather charts are hinting at significant snow on
Sunday. It is too early to be sure, so stay tuned! Paul Barys
