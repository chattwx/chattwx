Happy Saturday! It has been a gorgeous day across the Tennessee Valley!
Temperatures will cool quickly into the 40s after the sunsets under partly
cloudy skies. Overnight lows will bottom out in the upper-30s.

Cloud coverage will increase during the day on Sunday as a cold front approaches
from the west. Scattered showers will begin around 5-6 PM and continue into the
overnight hours. A few rumbles of thunder will be possible, but no severe
weather is expected. Total rainfall will be around half of an inch.

Skies will begin to clear Monday morning as much colder and drier air settles
into the region. Highs will range from 50-54 degrees Monday afternoon. Monday
night into Tuesday morning could very well be our coldest night so far this
season as lows drop into the 20s. Heavy jackets will be in order!

It will remain quite chilly Tuesday and Wednesday with highs in the low to
mid-50s and overnight lows around the freezing mark.

Thanksgiving Day will feature partly to mostly cloudy skies with comfortable
temperatures in the upper-50s. Our next rain maker looks to move in early
Friday.
