STORM ALERT WEATHER DAY

We are looking at the first snowfall of the season for a lot of folks today.
Here is how it will play out...

TEMPERATURE: Temps will be slowly falling through the afternoon. By 3pm we will
be at 39 in Chattanooga, and down to about 37 by 6pm. Temps will continue
falling through the night into the mid to upper 20s by early Tuesday morning.

PRECIPITATION: As we move through the early afternoon look for light snow
showers to fall on the Cumberland Plateau. At about 2pm we will start to see
some light snow showers in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It will still be snowing
lightly on the Plateau at the same time. After 8pm the snow on the plateau will
end, but continue on the Blue Ridge. Around midnight all precipitation will have
ended, and the focus will begin to change to the cold.

SNOWFALL AMOUNTS: There is a Winter Weather Advisory for Bledsoe, Van Buren,
Grundy, and Sequatchie Counties until 7am Tuesday. We will see up to 2.5" of
snow accumulating there. Counties south on the plateau will get anywhere from
.5"-1.5"". In the mountains, we could get 1.5"-2.5" from Ellijay to Murphy. Most
other folks will get about .5" in the mountains. In the valley and NW Georgia we
will get only flurries with little to no accumulation other than maybe a light
dusting on grassy surfaces. That would be the exception rather than the rule,
however.

WIND: I expect it to be a blustery day with winds coming from the northwest at
10-20 mph with higher wind gusts. It will remain breezy into the late night with
winds of 10-15 mph from the northwest.
