The fabulous weather of the weekend will continue right into the new work-week.
Today will begin cold in the 30s, but temperatures will rise quickly hitting the
upper 60s to 70 in the afternoon with a bright blue, sunny sky. Tonight will be
clear with patchy fog developing mainly in valleys and lows in the upper 30s to
low 40s.

Tuesday will have plentiful sunshine again for the first part of the day with
highs in the low 70s. High clouds will increase from the west late afternoon
into the evening, and then Wednesday will have a mix of sun and clouds with
highs in the low 70s. 

Then, Thursday becomes our active weather day. Generally quiet in the morning
and early afternoon, showers ahead of a cold front will arrive late Thursday
afternoon and continue into the night hours. Highs will be in the upper 60s.
Friday will have cooler highs around 60 with a mix of sun and clouds, and the
really cold air will settle in for Saturday with highs only around 50.
