Happy Saturday! Our weekend will begin with areas of patchy dense fog through 9
AM. Visibility may drop below a mile at times, so use caution if you will be out
and about this morning. After the fog lifts, skies will range from mostly sunny
to partly cloudy the rest of the day. High temperatures will top out in the low
to mid-80s, making for another warm October day.

Sunday will be very similar to today. Patchy fog will be around in the morning
with generally sunny skies during the afternoon hours. Temperatures will remain
warm, topping out in the 80s.

Monday through Thursday will feature a very similar pattern. Highs will reach
the 80s each afternoon with overnight lows dropping into the 60s. A stray shower
will be possible on Tuesday, but the rest of the upcoming week will remain dry.

Rain chances may return Friday as a potential cold front approaches the area.
Fall temperatures could also be in store for the Tennessee Valley. Stay tuned!
