Good Thursday. The rain is gone, but we still have numerous RIVER FLOOD WARNINGS
with creeks and streams experiencing minor flooding. They should all fall below
flood stage by Saturday at the latest.

Welcome to Dogwood Winter! The Dogwoods are blooming and that "surprise" burst
of cold air has moved in. Today will be blustery with highs in the upper 40s and
low 50s. Winds will blow from the NW at 10-20 mph with gusts to 30. A WIND
ADVISORY is in effect for north GA as winds may be a little stronger.

Friday will start even colder. Temps in the morning will plunge to the upper 20s
and low 30s. The winds will be lighter, but the high will only make it to 55.

Saturday will be sunny with temps ranging from 31 to 63 in Chattanooga. Easter
Sunday will start in the mid 30s, and we will make it to a sunny high of 70.

The first half of next week will be warm and dry with temps returning to the mid
to upper 70s.
