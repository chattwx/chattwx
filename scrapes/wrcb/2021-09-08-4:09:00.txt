Wednesday will be mostly sunny, warm, and humid. Highs today will range from
84-88 with heat index values topping out around 90. We'll have some scattered
clouds in the morning, and then a window in the middle of the day from about
10am to 5pm with lots of blue sky and sunshine. Then, a band of clouds will
increase this evening associated with a cold front. Only a couple of isolated
showers (20%) possible. The biggest weather storyline will be the dramatic
humidity drop overnight once the cold front passes. Lows will be in the low to
mid-60s.

Thursday will be fantastic with low humidity, sunny skies, and highs in the low
80s. Thursday night's lows will range from 55-60, and then Friday will be more
of the same - sunny and highs near 82. Saturday will warm slightly to the
mid-80s. Skies will remain sunny. The heat will start to rise again on Sunday
with highs near 88 and mostly sunny. Monday will be in the upper 80s to 90 with
slightly higher humidity, too.
