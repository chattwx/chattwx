Thursday through Saturday will be a bit warm and humid . We can expect partly
cloudy skies, lows in the 60s, and highs in the mid 80s.

Sunday we will make it to 81 with a good chance of scattered showers and
thunderstorms.

We cool down a bit next week, but we will also have a more wet pattern setting
up for the week as well. Monday and Tuesday will be in the mid 70s with cloudy
skies and scattered showers and storms. Wednesday will again carry a good chance
for showers and storms, but the high will only reach the low 70s. Low temps for
the first half of next week will be in the low 60s.
