Good Friday! Our weather will be flawless heading into the weekend. After
another cool start this morning we will warm into the low 70s this afternoon.
Skies will be mostly sunny. You may want to have a jacket for this evening as we
cool through the 60s. Overnight we will again fall into the mid to upper 40s.
Saturday afternoon also looks great with the temperature climbing into the upper
70s.

 

We will continue to warm up Sunday with temps ranging from a mile 57 in the
morning to 81 in the afternoon. Skies Sunday will be mostly cloudy. We may get a
sprinkle or two, but rain won't be a major issue for any activities you may
have.

The rain chance will be a bit higher Monday with scattered showers and a high of
82.
