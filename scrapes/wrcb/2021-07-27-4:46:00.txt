Good Tuesday. It's a hot and muggy one with spotty showers and thunderstorms
through the afternoon. We may even see one or two lingering into the late night.

Wednesday starts another level of heat. We will have sunny skies, and temps will
rapidly climb to about 97 for the high. I expect the heat index to reach 100.

Thursday the high will climb to 98 with a heat index of about 105! Skies remain
sunny.

Friday will be the same, though a weak front from the north may bring a few
spotty showers or storms late in the day.

Saturday we have only a slight chance for a shower as the high recedes to a more
respectable 92. Sunday and Monday we will be cooler in the mid-80s, but we will
also have a good shot for showers and thunderstorms on both days.
