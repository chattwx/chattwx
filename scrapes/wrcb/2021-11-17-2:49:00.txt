Good Wednesday. We will have mostly clear skies tonight with evening temps in
the upper 50s and overnight lows in the low to mid 50s. We will have good
viewing for the peak of the Leonid meteor shower tonight.

Thursday a cold front will bring in showers on and off through the day, but
accumulation will be light with only 1/10" to 1/4" falling all day. The high
will reach 65, but as we clear in the late afternoon colder air will start
moving in.

Friday will be sunny and cold with temps ranging from 35 to 55. Saturday we
start at 33 and make it 59. Sunday will be cloudy and a bit warmer with temps
ranging from 41 to 60.

Monday another front will bring in some early morning rain with temps in the low
40s climbing to about 50 as we clear out and cold air filters in.

Tuesday we bundle up as temps plummet to the 20s in the morning and only reach
the mid-40s in the afternoon. We will warm back up a little Wednesday and
Thanksgiving Day with highs in the 50s. However, the ugly Christmas sweater
might get soggy on Black Friday as we see another big front moving through
bringing more rain. Stay tuned.
