The mix of sun and clouds will continue for the rest of your Sunday afternoon
into the evening with comfortable temperatures in the 70s. Sunset is at 8:39pm
EDT. Then, overnight will be partly cloudy (at times mostly cloudy) with lows in
the mid-50s.

The big takeaways for the work-week will be quiet weather, little to no rain,
warming temperatures, and a southerly breeze. You'll feel the full effects of
these features by the end of the week.

Monday will be partly sunny with highs in the low 80s. Tuesday will be mostly
cloudy with highs in the upper 70s to 80. Wednesday will be partly sunny again
and warmer at 84. Each day will have a low-end chance for a spotty shower/storm
in the afternoon. Then, Thursday will become mostly sunny, hitting 85. Friday
will have abundant sunshine in the mid-80s. For next weekend, we may have our
first 90 degree day of 2021. Right now, I have Saturday as mostly sunny at 89
and Sunday hitting 91!
