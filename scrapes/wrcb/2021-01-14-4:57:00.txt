Good Thursday. It is another cold start with some patchy areas of frost and
freezing fog, though it won't be as widespread as yesterday morning. This
afternoon will bee much warmer in the low 50s with partly cloudy skies.

Tonight will be mild and cloudy with some rain showers overnight into Friday
morning. Rainfall amounts will range from 1/10" to 1/4". Temps will be in the
upper 30s so it will just be cold rain in the morning. Friday afternoon we will
be cooler with highs in the mid 40s.

Saturday morning we will have some light snow showers mainly in on the Plateau
and in the Blue Ridge. I would expect up to 1/2" of snow in those areas with
only flurries in the valley. Temps will range from 33 in the morning to a high
of only 42 in the afternoon.

Sunday will be cold, cloudy, and dry. The morning will be in the low 30s with
the highs in the mid 40s.
