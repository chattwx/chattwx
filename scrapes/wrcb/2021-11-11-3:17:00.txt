Quiet weather for your Thursday morning with a partly cloudy sky. A light spotty
shower will be possible in the morning but unlikely. If you need to do work
outside, the morning hours through noon will be your best bet. Highs today will
still be comfortable in the upper 60s to 70. Then, a broad line of rain will
move across our area from about 2-10 pm ET from west to east. The leading edge
should enter our western counties (Jackson, Grundy, Van Buren) around 2-3pm
ET/1-2pm CT and hit Chattanooga around 4-5pm ET. Afternoon and evening commutes
may be disrupted by this rain as it will be heavy at times. Additionally, a few
embedded thunderstorms will be possible, and this afternoon will be breezy with
wind sustained at 10-15mph, gusts at 20-25mph.

Conditions will clear up overnight into Friday morning, so expect a mostly sunny
Friday, starting in the low 40s with highs in the low 60s. A reinforcing shot of
cold air will arrive Friday night. Saturday's highs will be in the upper 40s to
low 50s, and then Sunday will begin in the upper 20s to low 30s followed by
highs near 54 under a parlty sunny sky.
