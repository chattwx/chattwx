Good Tuesday. Humidity will be the main theme of our forecast the rest of the
week. Today we will have a high of 87 with the heat index in the low 90s. We
will see overcast skies with a few spotty storms this afternoon into this
evening. The Lookouts are back in town and it will be humid with possibly a
storm or two during the game.

Wednesday temps will climb to a humid 85 with more widespread showers and storms
in the afternoon.

Thursday will start cloudy and muggy, then an approaching front will help spark
widespread showers and storms that will last on and off through the day Friday.

The weekend will be a little warmer and humid with highs in the upper 80s. We
will, again, have a good shot of at least a few showers and storms both
afternoons.

Next week we will see temps climbing to about 90, but the humidity will be lower
so that will make it a little more tolerable. No rain for at least the first few
days of next week.

There is a possible tropical disturbance developing in the Caribbean. It has a
30% chance for developing into a tropical storm within the next 5 days.
