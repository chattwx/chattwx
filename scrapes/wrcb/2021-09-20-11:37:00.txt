Rainy weather continues for your Monday. Expect light to moderate rain showers
today, and at times, heavy downpours. The bulk of the widespread rain will be
done by about 4-4:30pm this afternoon. Then, showers will become scattered for
the evening hours, reducing our flooding threat. Finally, the showers should
really fade out after 8pm. Most of our counties are under a Flash Flood Watch
until 8pm ET tonight.

Since the ground is already saturated from Saturday and Sunday, today's
additional rainfall may lead to localized flooding. Be especially aware of
standing water on roads, low-lying areas, and rises to small streams. Today will
stay in the 70s with an easterly breeze at 5-10mph.

Showers will decrease overnight, becoming scattered, and the scattered activity
will continue on Tuesday with some breaks in the clouds. Highs in the upper 70s
to low 80s. Then, a cold front will pass on Wednesday morning. We'll have
showers and probably some storms early Wednesday morning through lunch. Clouds
will then partially clear for Wednesday afternoon, and cooler, drier air will
move in - perfect timing for the first day of Fall. The rest of the week will
have lows in the upper 40s to low 50s and highs in the 70s with sunshine!
