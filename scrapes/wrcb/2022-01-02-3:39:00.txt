Happy Sunday! The wild start to 2022 will continue as rain changes over to snow
late this evening into the overnight hours. The transition will occur from west
to east between 9 PM and midnight. The highest amounts will likely fall east of
the I-75 Corridor, where 1-2" per hour snowfall rates could occur. Ground
temperatures are still very warm, which could cut into snowfall totals to a
certain extent, especially in the lower valley elevations.

Winter Storm Warnings are now posted for McMinn, Monroe, Cherokee, Murray,
Fannin, Gilmer, and eastern Polk Counties. 2-5" will be possible in these areas
with locally higher amounts in the higher elevations. Jackson County, Alabama is
also under a Winter Storm Warning where 1-3" will be possible.

The rest of the area is under a Winter Weather Advisory. A dusting to 2" will be
possible in the valley and across North Georgia. Plateau communities could
receive 1-3" with locally higher amounts.

There will likely be a very heavy band of snow developing later tonight, leading
to some areas overachieving with higher accumulations. There is also the chance
that the transition takes longer than expected, leaving some areas with very
little snow accumulation at all.

The snow will rap up between 4-7 AM Monday morning and the melting process will
begin as highs are expected to reach the low to mid-40s by Monday afternoon.
