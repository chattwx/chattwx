There is high fire danger today for some in west central Georgia. As the
relative humidity falls to 25% in spots, this includes southern Walker, Catoosa,
Gilmer, Fannin, Floyd, and Chattooga counties-use extreme caution when outdoor
burning today.

The humidity will be lower for everyone in the Tennessee Valley, falling to 25%
or lower by Tuesday night. Therefore, Wednesday through Friday, please use
extreme caution when outdoor burning for the entire Tennessee Valley.

It will remain cold in the upper 30s/low 40s through Thursday night. Winter
coats are needed for the Bus Stop, and if you plan on heading to Ice on the
Landing-as the season has kicked off.

Temperatures will continue to be slightly below normal, until this weekend. It
will get a little warmer by Saturday-Sunday with showers not returning until
next week...likely Monday!
