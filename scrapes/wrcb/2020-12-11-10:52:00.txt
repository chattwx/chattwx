Good Friday! We will be incredibly warm this afternoon with the highs reaching
the very spring-like mid 60s! Clouds will be increasing through the afternoon
into tonight.

We will get a few light showers overnight into Saturday morning. Temps will be
in the upper 40s and low 50s, so only rain, no snow. Temps will climb into the
low 60s in the afternoon as the light rain showers taper off leading to a
pleasant Saturday evening.

Sunday will be a nice day starting a bit cooler in the morning in the low 40s.
Sunday afternoon will be mostly cloudy with highs around 60. We will have a more
steady rain showers late Sunday night into Monday morning. It will primarily be
rain, but we may see a few areas of wintry mix in the higher elevations.
Rainfall accumulation will average between .5" and .75" with most of it falling
Sunday night.

Colder air moves in next week. Highs will be in the upper 40s and low 50s. Lows
will be in the 30s. A few more rain showers may move in by Wednesday.
