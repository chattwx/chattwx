Overnight we will have pleasant temps in the mid 60s with fairly low humidity. I
do think we may get a few showers and storms east of Chattanooga near Ellijay
and the Blue Ridge Mtns. early Tuesday morning (3am-6am). Heavy rain and
lightning appear to be the biggest threat.

Tuesday will be partly cloudy with the high reaching a very doable 86 degrees.
We may see an afternoon shower or two east of Chattanooga close to the Blue
Ridge Mtns.

Wednesday through Friday will sport highs in the mid-80s with manageable
humidity and a few afternoon showers here and there.

The weekend will see afternoon highs climbing back into the low 90s (where they
belong) with higher humidity. We should have a nice mix of sun and clouds this
weekend with only a slight chance for an afternoon shower or storm both days.
