We're continuing our Storm Alert Weather period through Sunday morning, so
please stay weather aware and have at least 2 ways to receive alerts.

For the rest of Saturday afternoon into the evening, we'll have scattered
showers and storms. Most will be below severe criteria, but a few may strengthen
to severe levels with hail, damaging wind gusts, and an isolated tornado can't
be ruled out. A Tornado Watch has been issued for Grundy County in TN and
Jackson County in AL until 9pm CT. The strongest storms for Saturday look to
clip our western counties, so Marion, Sequatchie, and Bledsoe Counties should
take extra care as well.

We'll have a lull in the night hours, and then comes our widespread severe
weather concern. Early Sunday morning, a well developed system ahead of a cold
front will race across the entire area from west to east from about 5:30am to
11am ET. The leading edge of it will pose a risk for severe storms with damaging
wind gusts as the primary threat. I expect there will be some tree damage and
power outages. Hail and an isolated quick spin-up tornado are low risk, but not
zero. Once the system passes, the rest of Sunday will be calmer. Wind will be
strong from the south in the early morning, then switching out of the northwest.
Gusts at 20-30mph. Temperatures in the 60s.

Rainfall totals will range from 0.75 to 2" for most, lower totals to the south.
Our northwest counties could receive 3". Flooding will be a threat as the ground
remains saturated from recent rains. All Tennessee counties, Cherokee Co, and
Jackson Co are under a Flash Flood Watch.
