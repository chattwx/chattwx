Good Friday! Our evening once again looks good with temps in the 50s under
partly cloudy skies.

Saturday will be overcast with temps starting in the upper 40s and warming about
20 degrees into the upper 60s. We may get a stray sprinkle or two.

Sunday will remain cloudy with a high of 64 and a few afternoon showers.

A more rainy pattern sets in next week. Monday we will have a front bringing in
rain showers for the first part of the day. Colder weather will move in Tuesday
with temps ranging from 32 in the morning 52 in the afternoon. We will see more
scattered showers late in the day with periods of heavy rain moving in
Wednesday. The high Wednesday will only reach 55.

Thursday and Friday will be a little warmer in the low 60s with only a slight
chance for a few showers each day.
