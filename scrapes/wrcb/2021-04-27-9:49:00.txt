While it's nearing the end of April, temperatures through Wednesday will feel
more like late May, as highs top near 85 today and 83 tomorrow. The record high
for today, April 27th, is 92°, however it will come close to the record high on
Wednesday, which is 88° from 1957.

The next two days provides a good time for prepping boats and gardens. Nights
will remain in the mid 50s to low 60s through Thursday night.

Showers will return on Thursday evening and overnight into Friday morning.
Rainfall amounts of 0.20" to 0.50" looks possible. Showers should end mid
morning on Friday, if not earlier with the frontal passage, moving through in
the morning.

It will turn cooler on Friday with highs in the upper 60s to near 70, and lows
returning to below normal in the mid 40s. 

The upcoming weekend looks dry and splendid for outdoor events and festivals
ongoing this weekend in the TN Valley!
