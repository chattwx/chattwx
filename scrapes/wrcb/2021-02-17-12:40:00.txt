Clouds will be increasing tonight and a wintry mix of rain, sleet, freezing
rain, and snow will move into our area. In the valley, we should see lows in the
mid-'30s. But in the higher elevations temperatures could be below freezing and
this will cause some very slick conditions. The worst of the weather will be
west of the Sequatchie Valley. There is the potential of a few inches of snow
over the Cumberland Plateau. But it could become mixed with sleet and even some
freezing rain before changing over to rain on Thursday.

Most of the area will see rain showers gradually fade out by Thursday afternoon.
Highs should be in the low 40's in the valley and in the mid to upper 30's
higher up. Thursday night will see lows dropping into the upper 20's to near 30
overnight. This could cause slick spots once again in some of the higher
elevations. Winds will be brisk and should evaporate much of the water on the
roads before freezing.

Friday will be clearing with highs in the low 40's. Saturday through Sunday will
see improving weather with highs in the mid to upper 40's Saturday and in the
mid to upper 50's Sunday.

Next week will start off with more rain on Monday and highs in the low 50's.
Tuesday and Wednesday will be dry with highs in the 60's. Paul Barys
