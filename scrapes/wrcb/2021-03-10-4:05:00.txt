Good Wednesday. Plan being outdoors as much as you can today. We will make it up
to a very warm 75 today with partly cloudy skies.

Thursday and Friday will be even warmer. Temps will start in the low 50s and
climb to the upper 70s on both days. Skies will be mostly cloudy.

Saturday and Sunday temps will recede a few degrees, but we will still have
highs in the low to mid 70s with lows in the 50s. Skies will remain fairly
cloudy through the weekend.[

Next week we will have some rain moving in Monday morning. Another burst of rain
will come in on Wednesday. Temps all next week will hover around 70.

Daylight Saving starts Sunday at 2am. Spring the clocks FORWARD one hour.
