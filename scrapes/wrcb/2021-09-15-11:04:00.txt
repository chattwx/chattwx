Rain chances will increase late this afternoon as deep Gulf moisture continues
to filter into the area. Scattered showers will begin to develop after 2 PM and
continue through the evening hours. Not everyone will receive rain today, but
those who do could be dealing with locally heavy rainfall. Otherwise, skies will
remain mostly cloudy with high temperatures ranging from 76-80 degrees.

Thursday and Friday will feature similar weather with slightly lower rain
chances. Skies will range from partly to mostly cloudy as highs climb into the
lower-80s each afternoon.

Temperatures will climb into the mid to upper-80s this upcoming weekend. Hit or
miss storms will be around mainly during the afternoon and evening hours but
shouldn't have much of an impact on your weekend plans.
