Good Wednesday. We may see a few isolated sprinkles lingering into the late
morning, but the theme of the day is really going to be the cool and windy
weather this afternoon. Temps won't get past the upper 50s and winds will be
blowing from the north at 10-20 mph. Skies will remain mostly cloudy.

We will be cool tonight with temps dropping into the mid to upper 40s by
Thursday morning. Thursday afternoon will be mostly cloudy and we will rebound
to a high of 70. We MAY get a stray sprinkle or two, but the chance is only 10%.

Friday will be a nice one. Temps will range from 49 to 73 with partly cloudy
skies. The weekend will be dry with warmer weather moving in. We will hit 75
Saturday and 80 Sunday.

Next week highs will be in the low 80s all week with varying chances for showers
and storms each day.
