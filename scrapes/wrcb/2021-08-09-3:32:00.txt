Good Monday. We have seen a few storms producing very heavy rain around the
area. Some isolated spots have received .5" to 1". We may get a few more
isolated storms as we make our way through the early evening. Heavy rain and
lightning would be the biggest threats. There is a slight chance for a few
Tuesday morning showers / storms.

Tuesday afternoon through Saturday I don't expect much variation in the weather.
Every day temps will range from the low 70s in the morning to the low 90s in the
afternoon. Increased humidity will be a big issue each afternoon. I expect the
heat index to get near 100 every day between 3 pm and 6 pm. Each afternoon will
also sport scattered storms that could produce heavy rain and lightning. Some
gusty winds in stronger storms can't be ruled out.

Sunday into next week we will see the humidity going down a bit and the
temperature should drop a few degrees as well.

We are watching one area of concern in the tropics. It will likely develop into
a tropical storm and impact Cuba this week.
