We picked up a big whopping, 0.01" at the airport over the last 24 hours.
Rainfall for the month is currently, 1.93" since April 1st, which is 1.6" behind
for the month.

For the year, we're still 3.98" above normal since January 1.

Look for clouds decreasing this afternoon. It will be breezy at times, with a
west/northwest wind, gusting 15-20 mph.

Tonight will be cool near 40-42Â° in Chattanooga. Those in the higher elevations
of Bledsoe, Sequatchie, Monroe, Rhea, Cherokee, will get temperatures briefly in
the upper 30s. I don't think enough for a frost.

Friday will bring broken clouds and a cool afternoon, only topping the mid to
upper 60s.

Rain arrives Friday night late and starts up south in Georgia and Alabama. New
model data shows light rain continuing through Saturday afternoon. Rainfall
amounts of 0.10" to 0.20" total are expected on Saturday.
