Happy Saturday, today will start off with patchy fog in our far western and
eastern counties. Grundy, Jackson, and DeKalb Counties are under Freezing Fog
Advisories, so please watch out for low visibility and also frost on bridges
this morning. Once we get through the fog, the rest of Saturday will be a crisp,
cool, sunny day. Highs will be from 50-55 for most with a light westerly breeze.
Tonight will be mostly clear with lows around freezing.

Sunday will have increasing clouds and highs near 54. There will be a chance for
a few light, isolated showers Sunday night which will continue into Monday. The
higher elevations on Monday may see a few flurries. Highs will only be in the
mid-40s. Tuesday will become mostly sunny with highs near 49. Wednesday and
Thursday will be sunny with only a few high clouds and in the mid-50s and near
60, respectively. The work week will end with broken cloud cover and highs
around 60 on Friday.
