T.G.I.F, everyone!

We will have a mix of clouds and sunshine throughout the rest of our Friday
afternoon. Temperatures will struggle to rebound back into the mid to upper 60s
with a light northerly breeze. You will want to bring a sweater or light jacket
with you for any of those Friday night football games. Temperatures will be
falling thru the 50s during the games.

Our Saturday morning will start off chilly again, with morning lows in the upper
30s and 40s. Look for plenty of sunshine and low humidity during the day. Highs
will warm near normal into the lower 70s. Sunday will feature more clouds and
some sun, with a stout southerly breeze. This will help boost our temperatures
back into the upper 70s for highs.

Next week looks more active and unsettled with a few good chances for showers &
storms. The first opportunity will arrive on Monday, with a more potent system
arriving Wednesday. Too early to dive into specifics but the threat for heavy
rain, strong storms, and another decent cool snap could all be in the cards by
our Halloween weekend.
