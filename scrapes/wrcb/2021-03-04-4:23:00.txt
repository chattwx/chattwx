Good Thursday. We made it to 66 yesterday with awesome sunshine and great
outdoor weather. After another cool start, we will make it to a whopping 69 for
the high. That is 10 degrees above normal.

Friday will start about the same in the mid to upper 30s. However, the afternoon
will be much cooler with partly cloudy skies and highs in the upper 50s.

The weekend is looking great. Saturday we will start in the upper 30s and make
it 60 for the high. Sunday will start much colder in the upper 20s and low 30s.
The afternoon will be awesome with blue skies and another high of 60.

Next week will feature a warm-up that will take us from a high of 62 Monday to
67 Tuesday to 71 Wednesday. Get the car washed as soon as you can. We will be
rain-free through Wednesday. It looks like a front may bring showers back to the
area by Thursday.
