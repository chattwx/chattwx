Happy Monday, everyone! It's going to be a mostly cloudy & cold Monday afternoon
around the Tennessee Valley. Temperatures will pretty much hold steady, or warm
just a few degrees today. High temperatures will hold into the 30s.

This evening, look for gradual clearing of the skies, with temperatures falling
from the 30s into the 20s overnight.

Tuesday will feature mostly sunny skies, and warmer temperatures. Highs will be
in the mid to upper 40s.

Clouds will be on the increase Wednesday, with our next cold front arriving
Wednesday afternoon & evening. Showers, with some brief local heavy rain will be
likely Wednesday evening. Late Wednesday night into early Thursday could feature
a brief mountain wintry mix, but overall impacts will be very minor.

Another shot of very cold air arrives by the late-week across the area with
highs struggling to climb above freezing. Our next weather maker could move in
from the south, leading to another chance of snow by Friday.

Have a great rest of your Monday!
