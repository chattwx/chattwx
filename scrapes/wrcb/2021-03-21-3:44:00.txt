We'll continue to have waves of clouds from the southeast for the rest of the
afternoon into the evening. Then, it'll become mostly clear by about 11pm or
midnight. Overnight lows will be in the upper 30s (east) to low 40s (west).
Monday will be warmer with highs around 70 and a mostly sunny sky with mainly
high clouds passing. Monday night will become mostly cloudy with mild lows in
the low 50s. 

A rainy pattern will then setup for Tuesday through Friday morning. Tuesday will
be mostly cloudy with a spotty shower chance in the morning and then scattered
showers/storms for the evening and night. Highs will be in the mid-60s.
Scattered showers continue on Wednesday in the upper 60s to 70. More widespread
rain will develop Thursday afternoon and continue through the night into Friday
morning. Another 1-3" of rain will be possible from Tuesday through Friday
morning, so we'll have to watch for flooding again. Plus, the threat for strong
storms Thursday night. Clouds will break Friday afternoon with highs in the low
70s.

Then, next weekend keeps fluctuating on rain chances, so check back if you have
outdoor plans.
