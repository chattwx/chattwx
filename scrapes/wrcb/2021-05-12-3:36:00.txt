Normally, we see highs near 80 this time of year. But for the next 48 hours
temperatures will be well below normal with lows in the 40's the next couple of
nights and highs near 70 Thursday and only in the mid 70's Friday. There may be
a sprinkle leftover in the Blue Ridge mountains on Thursday, but the rest of us
will be dry through the weekend.

Highs this weekend will rise back into the upper 70's and low 80's. A few light
showers may develop on Monday with highs near 80. Tuesday and Wednesday will be
mostly cloudy with highs in the low 80's. Paul Barys
