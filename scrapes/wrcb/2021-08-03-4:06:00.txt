Good morning, we're beginning this Tuesday with a few isolated showers for our
eastern counties. These showers will generally end before the sun rises. Today
will have a mix of sun and clouds. Mostly sunny in the morning, except for our
far eastern communities dealing with more clouds, and then, it'll become partly
sunny for the afternoon. Highs will once again be below normal and comfortable
in the mid-80s. Scattered showers/storms will develop for the afternoon all the
way through the evening, primarily affecting locations east of I-75 in TN and
east of I-59 in GA and AL (30%). Overnight, it'll be partly cloudy with lows
from 62-68.

Wednesday will be partly sunny with scattered showers and storms possible across
the entire area. Highs will be in the low to mid-80s. Thursday will be mostly
sunny with highs near 87 and only an isolated shower chance. Clouds will
increase on Friday with highs in the mid-80s with a few showers. By Saturday and
Sunday, the heat will be back with highs around 90 and only a spotty shower.
