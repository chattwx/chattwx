Happy New Year! We are starting 2022 with a Storm Alert Weather Day. The first
part of your day will be mainly quiet with only a few showers through this
afternoon. High temperatures will be warm, topping out in the low to mid-70s.
Wind Advisories will be in effect this afternoon as wind gusts up to 25-35 mph
will develop ahead of an approaching cold front.

The potential for severe storms will begin around 6 PM for our western
communities and continue until around 2 AM. Damaging winds and isolated
tornadoes will be the main threat. Be sure to have multiple ways of receiving
severe alerts this evening!

Temperatures will drop sharply during the day on Sunday as colder air settles
into the region. We are also monitoring the potential for a transition from rain
to snow showers late Sunday evening into the overnight hours. For now, any
accumulations will be light and mainly confined to the Plateau and eastern
mountains.

We will finally clear out on Monday with cold temperatures in the low to mid-40s
to start the first week of 2022.
