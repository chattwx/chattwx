Good afternoon! Temperatures will slowly climb into the low to mid-60s this
afternoon under mostly sunny skies. Cloud cover will increase during the
overnight hours as a strong system moves into the southeast. Scattered showers
will begin after 3 am and continue through Thursday morning.

Periods of rain, gusty winds, and a few thunderstorms will continue throughout
the day on Thursday. Wind Advisories have been issued for our Georgia counties
through 6 pm Thursday for gusts up to 35 mph. Gusts of 20-25 mph will develop
across the rest of our area with gusts of 45+ mph possible in elevations over
2,000 feet.

On and off showers will continue Friday through Saturday before gradually
tapering off. Total rainfall amounts of up to an inch will be possible through
Saturday afternoon. Temperatures will be unseasonably cool both Friday and

Conditions look to clear out just in time for your Halloween festivities!
