Good Monday. What a perfect start to the workweek. The clear skies continue
tonight with temps this evening in the upper 40s and low 50s. We will keep
dropping through the night to a low of 38 Tuesday morning.

Tuesday will be another warm one with a few clouds building in during the
afternoon and a high of 73.

Wednesday will be warmer in the morning with temps in the mid-40s. We will again
hit 73 for the high. Skies will be partly cloudy

Thursday will be dry starting off with a morning temp of about 50. Late in the
day, a cold front will bring in rain showers and maybe a rumble of thunder. The
rain will linger into late night, ending during the overnight into Friday
morning.

That will set the stage for a cooler weekend. Friday afternoon will be dry with
a high of 63. Saturday temps will range from 43 to only 50 and Sunday we will go
from 35 in the morning to a high of 54.
