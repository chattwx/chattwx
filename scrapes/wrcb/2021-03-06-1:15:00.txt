We are going to stay with a mild dry weather pattern for the next week or so. I
see very little change in the precipitation pattern. Temperatures will start to
go up as a more spring-like pattern develops. Expect more sunshine for Sunday
with highs into the low 60's along with a light north wind. Monday will be a bit
warmer with highs in the mid 60's and more sunshine.

Tuesday and Wednesday will see lows in the '40s and highs near 70 with partly
cloudy skies in the form of high clouds. Thursday will be a bit warmer with
highs in the mid 70's and partly cloudy skies.

Friday will be warmer with highs in the upper 70's and partly cloudy skies. Next
Saturday may have a few scattered showers with highs in the mid 70's. Paul Barys
