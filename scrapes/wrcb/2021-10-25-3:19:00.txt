Happy Monday, everyone!

After a few passing showers around midday, things are already improving across
the region this afternoon. A cold front is moving through the area this evening,
leading to breezy conditions. Temperatures will drop from the 60s into the 50s
by late this evening, and into the 40s by early Tuesday morning.

Tuesday & Wednesday will feature a mixture of clouds and some sunshine. Morning
temps will be in the 40s, with afternoon highs in the mid to upper 60s.

Clouds will be on the increase Wednesday night, ahead of our next significant
weather maker. A potent storm system moves our way Thursday bringing more
widespread showers & even a few rumbles. Right now, the greatest severe weather
threat with this system looks to set up along & south of the I-20 border, but
heavy rain and gusty winds will be possible here in the Tennessee Valley. This
system will basically get stuck over the area heading into the weekend, leading
to scattered periods of clouds and showers. Temperatures will also be WELL below
normal, with daytime highs some 10-15 degrees below where they should be.

The good news is that the entire pattern clears just in time for Halloween,
leading to plenty of sunshine during the day, and clear skies during the
evening. Highs will be in the 60s, but evening temps will be falling through the
50s into the 40s.

Have a great evening!
