Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day for potential isolated severe storms this
afternoon, but first, we'll have rain showers in the morning from about 5-7am,
primarily affecting TN. Then, there will be a slight lull period with a mostly
cloudy sky and high temperatures from about 79-84. Next up will be the time to
be weather aware. 

From about 1-8pm ET, a series of storms will move across the area from west to
east. Within these storms, there will be pockets of heavy rain, lightning, and
an isolated severe storm possible. It's a low-end threat, but all our counties
are under a Level 1 Marginal Risk. The primary threat will be damaging wind
gusts. Secondary - hail from pea to quarter size. We need the rain with totals
from 0.25-1".

Tonight, scattered showers will linger until about 1am, followed by much cooler
air. Saturday's highs will be in the upper 60s to low 70s with a mostly cloudy
sky and low humidity. Sunday will warm up for a beautiful day with highs near 78
and lots of sun. Memorial Day will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 80s -
84 in Chattanooga. Chances for rain will increase again on Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday of next week.
