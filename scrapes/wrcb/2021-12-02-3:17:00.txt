Spring-like weather for the next 2 days with afternoon highs in the upper 60s to
low 70s. It'll still be cool in the mornings but not freezing cold. Both today
and Friday will be mostly sunny. Evening time temperatures will be in the low
60s to upper 50s for Christmas parades or tree lightings.

Saturday will be mostly cloudy with highs near 68. Sunday partly sunny and in
the mid-60s. Both days will have a slim spotty shower chance, but our next great
rain chance will be for Sunday night through Monday morning. We need the rain
after a dry November. These showers will be associated with a cold front, so
expect temperatures to drop on Monday. Highs should be near 55. Then, quickly
cooling in the evening with overnight lows back down to the upper 20s to low
30s. Tuesday will be partly cloudy with highs in the low 50s. Another round of
rain will arrive on Wednesday.
