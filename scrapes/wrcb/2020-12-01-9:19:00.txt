Official numbers are in for the first snow of the season. Hot House in Cherokee
County picked up 2.5" last night and this morning. Cades Cove, near 2", and
areas like Altamont and Palmer picked up 1" to 2", making a nice winter
wonderland in the Great Smoky Mountains this morning.

It will continue to be cold with nights in the upper 20s tonight and Wednesday
night. Temperatures will improve by Friday, however showers return by the end of
the week. I don't see winter weather for Friday-Saturday, however as colder air
filters in Monday, a few flurries can't be ruled out Sunday-Monday again.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunshine and Cold, 38

3PM: Sunshine, 43

6PM: Clear, 36
