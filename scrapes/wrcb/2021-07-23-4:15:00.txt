The summer heat and hazy skies continue for your Friday. It'll be in the mid-80s
by noon and then low 90s for the afternoon with the heat index in the mid-90s.
Once again it will be a sunny day with only a few afternoon clouds, but the blue
sky will be muted by wildfire smoke. The smoky, hazy sky will be with us all day
on Friday. Cherokee County in NC has another Code Orange Air Quality Alert for
today through midnight for particulate matter (smoke particles). This level
means the air is "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups." Additionally, the rest of the
viewing area's air quality will be lower today than yesterday. The Air Quality
Index (AQI) in Chattanooga is forecasted at 100 today, which is the cut-off of
the Moderate category before moving into the Orange category. Therefore, as a
precaution anyone with respiratory diseases, such as asthma or COPD, please try
limit strenuous outdoor activities.

This evening will be warm in the 80s under a clear sky with overnight lows in
the upper 60s to low 70s. Saturday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low
90s and only a spotty shower chance. Sunday will be similar, becoming partly
cloudy with a few isolated showers. Rain chances will increase to scattered on
Monday and Tuesday - still around 90 degrees.
