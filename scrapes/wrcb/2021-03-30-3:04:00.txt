A Flash Flood Watch is valid Wednesday for the Tennessee Valley as heavy rain
and thunderstorms return.

Clouds will be increasing tonight and after midnight showers and possibly a
thunderstorm could develop. Low temperatures will be mild and near 60. Showers
and storms will be all across the Tennessee Valley Wednesday. Some of the storms
could be strong with gusty winds and hail. Rainfall amounts should be between 1
and 2 inches.

Wednesday night will turn colder as the rain ends. There could be a few flurries
in the higher elevations. Winds will be strong and out of the northwest at 15 to
20 mph with stronger gusts. Thursday will be blustery with highs in the low 50's
along with some clouds. Winds will continue strong at 15 to 25 mph and stronger
gusts out of the northwest.

Friday through Tuesday will be dry with lots of sunshine. Highs will be in the
mid 50's Friday and in the mid 60's Saturday. Friday morning will be frosty with
lows near 30 in the city and 20's elsewhere, so expect freezing temperatures.
More frost is possible Saturday morning. Sunday and Monday will be in the 70's
with lows in the 40's. Paul Barys
