Good Morning, and welcome to November! We're kicking off the new month with
patchy fog. The densest fog will be along the Sequatchie Valley in Tennessee
extending into the TN River Valley in Alabama. Other river and valley locations
will also have fog, including reduced visibility in spots around Chattanooga.
Foggy conditions will last until about 10am ET. Then, the rest of your Monday
will have no weather issues with mostly sunny skies and highs in the mid-60s.
Tonight will be mostly clear with lows in the low to mid-40s.

Tuesday will have more clouds for a partly sunny day with a slim chance for a
couple of spotty light showers in the morning hours for our northern
communities. Highs will be cooler in the low 60s. Then, we'll really feel the
chill on Wednesday and Thursday with mostly cloudy to cloudy skies and highs in
the upper 40s to low 50s. A few isolated showers will be possible on Wednesday
with scattered showers on Thursday. Friday's morning lows will only be in the
mid-30s, followed by a mostly sunny afternoon with highs in the mid-50s.
