Good Friday! We are much cooler this morning with temps running about 5-10
degrees below yesterday morning. We should stay in the mid to upper 60s this
afternoon with skies clouding up a bit.

Saturday will be overcast with a few light showers here and there and temps
ranging from 50 to 67.

Sunday will remain cloudy, but little to no rain. We will start cool in the
mid-40s, then warm to a very nice 70 in the afternoon.

Monday will be a perfect spring day. The sun will be back in full force and
highs will be in the low 70s.

We will get another short-lived burst of cool air later this week with highs
falling into the low 60s by Wednesday!
