Good morning, until about 10am, there will be scattered light rain showers and
wintry mix passing across our area, along with falling temperatures. The wintry
mix shouldn't cause too many issues with above freezing road temperatures, but
please remain cautious for a few slick spots especially on bridges and
overpasses in our northwest counties.

The warmest air of the day has already happened during the early morning hours.
It'll continue to cool off through mid-morning with most locations spending much
of the day in the 30s. There will also be a blustery north wind at 10-15mph,
gusts at 20-25mph. Thus, a lot chillier today than yesterday. Tonight will drop
into the low to mid-20s with the continuation of the north wind. The wind will
help dry off roads, but be mindful Friday morning of patches of black ice.

Friday will be mostly cloudy for much of the area with some blue sky for our
northwest communities. It'll be a cold day with highs only in the mid-30s. The
weekend will feature very cold mornings in the upper teens to low 20s with
afternoons in the 40s with mostly sunny skies. Highs won't return to the low 50s
until Monday.
