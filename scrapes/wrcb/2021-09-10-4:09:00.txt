If you loved yesterday's weather, then you're going to be very happy with today,
too. Most locations are starting off in the 50s this morning, so you may want a
light jacket. It'll warm to the mid-70s by noon and then afternoon highs in the
upper 70s to low 80s. Humidity will be low all day long with only a light
breeze. It'll be a sunny day with a few afternoon clouds developing. Friday
Night Football Games, Nightfall, or any other Friday evening plans will be
comfortable in the 70s. Overnight lows will drop into the 50s under a clear sky.

Saturday will be sunny again and a bit warmer around 85 in the afternoon. The
heat will be back by Sunday with highs in the upper 80s and slightly more humid.
Monday will have some high thin clouds mixed with sunshine with highs near 90
and higher humidity. Tuesday will have a mix of sun and clouds in the upper 80s.
Then, rain chances finally return on Wednesday and Thursday with scattered
showers and storms.
