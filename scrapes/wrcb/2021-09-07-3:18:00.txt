Good Tuesday. The humidity will be building this evening and it will also be a
little warmer with temps in the upper 70s and low 80s through most of the
evening.

Wednesday will be a warm, muggy one with morning temps in the mid to upper 60s
(70 in Chattanooga) and highs in the mid to upper 80s. We may get a stray shower
or two east of Chattanooga.

Thursday and Friday are the days we are living for. Thursday afternoon we will
be in the low 80s with rock-bottom humidity and sunny skies. Friday morning will
be the best thing you've ever felt. We will start in the upper 50s and low 60s
and climb to only 84 with the low humidity and sunshine sticking around.

The weekend will be a bit warmer, but still nice with the high Saturday reaching
87 and 88 on Sunday.

Next week will start hot and humid with highs around 90.
