Good Monday. Skies will remain fairly clear this evening with temps dropping
through the upper 80s to about 80 by 10 pm.

Tuesday will be a scorcher. We will hit 94 for the high with the heat index
close to 100. Skies will be mostly sunny, though a stray shower is possible over
the Blue Ridge Mtns.

Wednesday will be a repeat with a 94 degree high and the heat index again in the
upper 90s. East of Chattanooga we may get a shower or two, but the chance is
very slight.

Thursday and Friday temps recede a bit with the high near 90 and a few showers
and storms each afternoon.

I expect much the same for the weekend. 89 on Saturday. 87 on Sunday. Spotty
showers will be possible both afternoons.

There are several systems in the Atlantic that have a chance to develop over the
next few days.
