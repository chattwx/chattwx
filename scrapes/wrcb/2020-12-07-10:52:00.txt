Good Monday. We start the week a little cool and breezy. Temps will be around 40
degrees through most of the afternoon, cooling through the 30s by the time folks
are heading home from work. We will also be breezy with winds from the NW at
10-15 mph. We MIGHT see a few flurries in the Blue Ridge Mtns. this afternoon.

Temps will continue falling into the mid to upper 20s by Tuesday morning. The
high Tuesday will only reach about 49. Skies will be sunny.

Wednesday we will start in the 20s, but warm nicely into the upper 50s under
sunny skies.

Thursday will be a nice day with temps ranging from a cool 33 in the morning to
65 in the afternoon. It will stay warm all day Friday going from 51 in the
morning to 61 later in the day.

Saturday another front will bring rain through much of the day into the evening.
I expect up to an inch of rain. We will clear out Sunday and be a little cooler.
Look for morning temps in the low 30s, and afternoon highs where they should be
in the low 50s.
