Good Friday! We should have muggy and hazy weather this evening as temps drop
from about 90 at 7 pm through the 80s. No rain tonight!

The smoky skies from the western wildfires will linger through at least the
first part of the day Saturday. Saturday afternoon will feature sunny skies and
a very toasty 93 degrees with the heat index reaching about 98. You MAY get a
sprinkle in the Blue Ridge late in the day, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.

Sunday and Monday I will up the rain chance to 30% on both days. We may get a
few showers and rumbles of thunder. It will still be hot and muggy with the high
reaching about 90 both Sunday and Monday.

The rest of next week we will be in a bit of a heat wave in which we will have
no rain, highs in the mid-90s, and heat index values just north of 100.

A note of interest... there is a tropical wave off the east coast that the Nat'l
Hurricane Center is giving a 40% chance of development into a tropical
depression within the next few days so we will be watching that as well.
