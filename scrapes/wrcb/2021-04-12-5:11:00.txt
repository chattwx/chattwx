Good Monday. We will start the week warm and sunny with highs in the upper 70s
and low 80s. We may be a bit breezy with winds from the west at 10-15 mph.
Pollen counts will be extremely high today.

Tuesday temps will range from 52 in the morning to 81 in the afternoon. We will
be mostly cloudy, and might even see a stray passing shower or two in the
afternoon north of Chattanooga.

Wednesday showers will be likely through the day. We will get .5" to .75" of
rain through the day so it may be heavy at times. No severe weather with this
round of rain. The high Wednesday will only get to 72.

Thursday and Friday will be much cooler. Lows will be in the low to mid 40s, and
highs will only make it to the upper 60s.

Temps over the weekend will remain in the upper 60s. We will be mostly cloudy
over the weekend, but the chance for any rain is very low.
