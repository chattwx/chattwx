Happy Monday, everyone! It's a sunny, beautiful looking day across the area.
Temperatures are cooler however, and will likely remain below normal this
afternoon. High temps will likely hold into the mid to upper 40s across the
region. Tonight, look for clear skies and light winds. Overnight lows should
drop into the 20s.

Tuesday will feature more sunshine, but cool temps. Highs a few degrees cooler
than today.

We start a slight warming trend for the 2nd half of the week, before another
blast of cooler air arrives late week into the weekend. A potent clipper system
arrives for Saturday into Sunday bringing rain showers during the day, and a
chance for a few flakes Saturday night, if the moisture hangs around. Something
to keep an eye on this week for trends.

Have a great Monday!
