Good Wednesday. It will be a warmer evening with clouds increasing and temps
falling through the 60s.

Thursday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. A cold front will move through during the
day. We will see some spotty areas of rain in the morning. Early afternoon will
be cloudy, but we will see little to no rain until about 4 pm. From 4 pm to 8 pm
we will have a line of scattered thunderstorms moving through. The biggest risks
will be from heavy rain, lightning, and damaging winds. The potential for small
hail can't be ruled out either. I do not expect any tornadoes with this system
at all.

As the front moves out Thursday night into Friday we will cool down a bit.
Friday temps will range from 54 in the morning to only 69 in the afternoon.

Saturday will be a nice one with a cool start as temps drop into the mid to
upper 40s. The afternoon will be perfect with a high of 73.

Sunday we may get a few spotty showers with temps starting in the mid 50s and
climbing to the upper 70s.
