Good Friday! Some folks got more than 3" of rain, we have some reports of
flooding, wind damage, hail, and even a lightning-induced fire, but the tornado
threat mercifully did not come to fruition. The brunt of the tornado activity
was absorbed by our neighbors in Alabama and Georgia from Birmingham to
Peachtree where numerous reports of damage and loss of life are coming in.

With that said, by contrast, today will provide a picture-perfect end to the
week in the Tennessee Valley with mostly sunny skies and highs in the mid 70s.

The weekend will see more storms moving in. Look for a few spotty storms mainly
north of Chattanooga Saturday afternoon into Saturday night. The high Saturday
will reach 76. There is a small risk some of those isolated storms could produce
damaging winds and isolated tornadoes, especially on the plateau west to Middle
Tennessee.

Palm Sunday we will have more widespread rain and storms through the morning.
There, again, will be a small risk for those storms to become severe with the
highest risk being the plateau and west. We will clear out and cool down in the
afternoon with highs in the upper 60s.
