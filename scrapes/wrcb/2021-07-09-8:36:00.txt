Happy Friday! Sporadic downpours and storms will affect our counties in TN and
NC during the early morning hours. Then, from about mid-morning through around
6pm, coverage will increase as scattered showers/storms will be likely
area-wide, generally moving from the NW to SE. Things will quiet down for Friday
night with only a few isolated showers in TN and NC. The peak timing should be
in the afternoon. Remember, anytime you have summertime storms, a few isolated
strong to severe storms may be possible. Because this rainfall is scattered, the
average total for places receiving rain looks to be 0.1-0.25" with repeated
storms producing 0.5-1".

Highs on Friday ranging from 83-88 for most locations. If you don't receive any
cooling rain, it will be very muggy today with the heat index topping out in the
low 90s with a mostly cloudy to partly sunny sky.

Most of Saturday will be dry, partly sunny, and highs in the upper 80s.
Scattered shower/storm chances at 30%. Sunday will have some scattered
showers/storms in the afternoon (40%), especially west, otherwise humid and
highs near 88. Keep your outdoor plans for the weekend as neither day will be a
washout, but have a backup in case a storm heads your way.
