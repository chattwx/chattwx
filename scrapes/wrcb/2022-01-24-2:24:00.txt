Good Monday. It was a pretty nice afternoon and will remain so through the
evening with temps dropping through the 40s. A jacket will be needed, but it
will still feel nice.

We will get a warmer start Tuesday in the low to mid-30s and climb to a very
tolerable 51 for the high.

The cold air returns Wednesday with temps ranging from 26 to 42.

We will dip to the low to mid-20s again Thursday morning but warm to a cool but
nice high of 50.

Our next shot of even colder air will start moving in Friday. We will start with
a pleasant low of 36 but only climb to a high of 42. We may see a few showers
through the day Friday, and maybe even a very light wintry mix into the
overnight. But make no mistake. Cold air will be the main feature of this
system.

It will really settle in Saturday. We will start at 23 and only make it to 35
for the high!

Sunday we will start in the 20s, but manage to sneak up to 47 in the afternoon.
