Good Sunday evening. It will be even a little cooler tonight with temps this
evening in the mid 50s, but dropping into the upper 30s and low 40s by early
morning.

After the chilly start Monday we will have a great afternoon with clear blue
skies and a high of 70.

Tuesday and Wednesday we warm a little with temps in the morning hovering in the
mid 40s and highs reaching the low to mid 70s. Both days will have more sun than
clouds.

Thursday another front will bring us scattered showers and thunderstorms late
morning through the afternoon. Thursday the high will manage to reach 73.

Friday through the weekend we will dry out with the sun returning. Cooler air
will return as well with highs in the upper 60s and lows in the mid to upper
40s.
