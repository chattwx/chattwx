Happy Labor Day weekend! Another sunny day is on tap for the Tennessee Valley
with high temperatures topping out in the mid-80s. Temperatures will fall back
into the 60s tonight under partly cloudy skies. Overall, your Saturday will be a
perfect 10 out of 10 weather-wise.

A weak front will approach the region late Sunday, sparking a few hit or miss
showers after 8 PM. Otherwise, skies will remain partly cloudy with highs back
in the mid-80s. A few lingering showers will be around early Monday morning with
skies gradually clearing by the afternoon hours. High temperatures will once
again top out in the mid-80s making for a fantastic Labor day!

The rest of the week will feature plenty of sunshine with only a small chance of
a shower Tuesday or Wednesday. A reinforcing cold front will push through late
Wednesday, gifting us with another fall preview for the end of the week!
