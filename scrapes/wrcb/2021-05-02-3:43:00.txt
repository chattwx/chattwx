For the rest of your Sunday, it'll be mostly cloudy to cloudy with comfortable
temperatures in the 70s and a few isolated light showers this evening. Then,
around 11pm through the overnight, scattered hit and miss storms will enter our
area.

Monday and Tuesday will be Storm Alert Weather Days. Both days will have
scattered hit and miss showers and general thunderstorms - meaning individual
cells where your town may get rain and the neighboring one won't. Within those
storms, a few isolated ones may strengthen to become strong to severe on Monday.
General Timing: morning through afternoon. Tuesday, the risk is slightly higher
with scattered severe storms possible. General Timing: morning wave, but
especially afternoon through night.

Both days - the biggest threats will be wind and hail. The tornado risk is very
low but possible. Flooding will become a concern on Tuesday if storms continue
to move across the same areas. Rain/storms will end on Wednesday morning as a
cold front passes and clouds will slowly break for a partly sunny afternoon.
Highs on Monday and Tuesday will be around 80, then cooler in the low 70s on
Wednesday.
