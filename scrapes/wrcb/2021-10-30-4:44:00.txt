Happy Halloween weekend! Temperatures will hold steady in the mid-50s through
this evening under overcast skies. Areas of mist/drizzle will gradually come to
an end overnight with lows ranging from 46-50 degrees. Patchy fog will develop
after 3 AM which could lead to areas of reduced visibility Sunday morning.

Sunday will feature much nicer weather as skies continue to clear during the
day. Temperatures will top out in the mid-60s and gradually fall back into the
50s as the kiddos head out the door for trick-or-treating.

Pleasant weather will continue through the middle of the week before our next
weather maker arrives towards the end of the week. This system will bring our
next rain chances plus much cooler temperatures. In fact, we could be dealing
with our first frost of the season heading into next weekend!
