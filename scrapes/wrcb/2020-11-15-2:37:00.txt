Sunshine is the name of the game from now through next Saturday. For the rest of
today, enjoy the sunny sky and temperatures in the 60s. Wind will die down after
sunset, shifting from out of the west to out of the north by tonight. It'll
become chilly overnight with a clear sky and lows in the mid to upper 30s.

Coats will be needed each morning of the week with cold temperatures. Even
afternoon highs will be cool - seasonable to below normal. Sunny skies at day
and clear nights are in store. Monday and Tuesday will have highs around 60.
Wednesday will be cooler with highs in the mid-50s. Thursday will be back up
around 60, and then expect mid-60s for Friday. Saturday will be mostly sunny and
68. Then, we'll have some clouds next Sunday with a partly sunny sky.

Heads up the Leonid Meteor shower is peaking on Monday night into Tuesday
morning. The best time to watch is around 3AM, but you can try to spot them any
time from midnight to 6AM up in the eastern sky. At peak, you could see 10 to 15
meteors per hour. The moon will be a thin waxing crescent as the New Moon was
just last night, which helps with meteor viewing.
