A cold front is heading our way and it will kick off showers and storms for
tonight before ending on Friday. The showers and storms will be scattered, but
some of them could turn heavy! On Friday we may see a few leftover morning
showers, but drier air will move in throughout the day. Highs will be in the low
to mid 80's. Friday night will be clearing off with lows in the low 60's.

Saturday and Sunday will be dry and seasonable to a little bit below normal.
Sunshine will be abundant with highs in the mid to upper 80's. Monday and
Tuesday will be warmer with highs in the low 90's. Skies should be partly
cloudy.

Wednesday and Thursday will only see a few isolated showers with highs averaging
near 90. Paul Barys
