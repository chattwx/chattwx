A Freeze Warning will continue both tonight and likely Friday night as lows will
dip to 30-32Â° for several hours.

Winds will be lighter tonight, and therefore bringing a better chance at frost
early in the morning tomorrow and again Friday.

Bring potted plants in for both the next two nights, and lay a blanket for
sensitive vegetable seedlings starting to come up.

Our weather pattern shifts from cold over the next 36 hours, to mild and more
April like just in time for Easter Sunday.

Hug a Bunny Day is tomorrow and Saturday at the Chattanooga Zoo. It will be cold
in the morning in the mid 30s at 9AM. Bring the winter coat if you are headed
early in the day. Highs tomorrow will stay in the 50s (again).

Our weather pattern will be dry into early next week, too. Very little rain
chances come next week mid week. The next chance for any measurable rainfall,
may not arrive until the following Friday.

TONIGHT:

6PM: 47 Sunny, (Wind Chill, 41)

9PM: 41 Clear, (Wind Chill, 35)

12AM: 37 Clear (Wind Chill, 30)
