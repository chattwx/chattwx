Good Wednesday night. It's starting to get a bit cool out. We can expect light
jacket weather by Thursday morning as we see temps relatively plunge into the
mid to upper 40s (it is May, keep in mind). Thursday afternoon will be mostly
sunny with the high reaching a pleasant 73.

We can expect some clouds to roll in Thursday evening along a front. That front
may bring a few spotty showers Thursday evening into late Thursday night. Most
folks will get 1/10" to 1/4" at best. It will quickly dry out, and the rest of
your Friday will be awesome. Temps will be cool starting in the upper 40s and
low 50s, and climbing to only 70.

Saturday will be cool also with temps ranging from 50 to 69. I do, however,
expect some rain showers and maybe a rumble of thunder Saturday late morning
into the afternoon. Mother's Day will start dry day as we warm dramatically into
the mid 70s. I expect some scattered showers and storms Sunday evening into
Monday.
