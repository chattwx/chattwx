Some of you are waking up to a Winter Wonderland this Sunday morning, especially
along the Cumberland Plateau where a widespread 2-3" of snow has fallen, locally
higher. Even valley spots are receiving a little snow this morning from Apison
to Dalton to Cleveland to Athens. A dusting to 0.5" for Cleveland and Dalton
before the snow ends and closer to 1" for areas near Athens and Dayton. The
residual rain and snow will be moving out from southwest to northeast from about
6am to 9am. Most road temperatures are above freezing, except for the Cumberland
Plateau and mountain roads, so please be careful driving in those locations.

Now, for the rest of Sunday, low level clouds will be slow to clear. It'll
gradually become partly sunny for the afternoon. It'll be a cool day with temps
in the 30s this morning and mid-40s for the afternoon. Tonight will be mostly
clear with lows in the upper 20s to low 30s.

Monday will be warmer and mostly sunny with highs in the mid-50s. Expect more
clouds for Tuesday and Wednesday. Both days will be mild around 60 with a few
isolated showers. Thursday will have more widespread rain, ending on Friday.
