Good Monday. Colder air will continue to spill in through the evening. Temps
this evening will drop from the 40s into the 30s with gusty winds from the
north. Temps will continue dropping into the mid to upper 20s with temps in the
low 20s in the Blue Ridge Mtns. Protect the pipes and pets tonight!

We will stay pretty chilly all day Tuesday with sunshine and highs in the upper
40s, maybe reaching 50 in a few spots.

Wednesday starts cold in the mid to upper 20s, however, we will warm nicely
making it into the mid-50s.

Thanksgiving temps will be cool but tolerable ranging from 35 in the morning to
59 in the afternoon. We will have clouds building through the day with some
light rain showers moving through during the evening hours.

Colder air settles back in Black Friday. Shoppers will bundle up in the morning
with temps in the upper 20s and low 30s. And we will only muster a 49 degree
high in the afternoon.

The weekend will be cool and dry with lows in the 20s and 30s, and highs in the
mid-50s.
