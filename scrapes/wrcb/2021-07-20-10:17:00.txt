Good Morning, 

RAINFALL

Now….we're at a surplus! Rain at the airport on Monday: 1.2" – this moves us to
4.16" since July 1st, which is now 0.95" above normal. 

The Flash Flood Watch continues for Jackson, DeKalb, and Franklin counties, and
all of our Georgia communities until 10PM local time. Although this will likely
be canceled earlier, a few showers this afternoon, on top of a saturated soil
could lead to run off and minor flooding. An additional 0.50" to 1" is possible
today for areas like Gilmer, Murray, Whitfield, and Fannin counties.

TONIGHT

The bulk of the rain however is done, and it will dry out for the Lookouts game
tonight. 

WED-THURS

The rain chance is lower on Wednesday and Thursday giving photographers an
opportunity at Smith Perry Berries those days.

12PM: 76, Isolated showers

3PM: 80, Isolated showers

6PM: 70, showers ending
