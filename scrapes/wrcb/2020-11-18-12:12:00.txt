Sunshine will continue through the rest of the week and into the beginning of
the weekend. Highs on Thursday will be in the low 60's and by Friday highs
should be in the mid to upper 60's. Saturday will see some high clouds moving in
with highs in the upper 60's to near 70. Sunday will see increasing clouds but
highs will remain warm and near 70 or so.

 

On Monday a few isolated showers could develop, but they will remain separated
and light. Highs will remain in the mid to upper 60's. Tuesday will be partly
cloudy with highs in the upper 60's. Wednesday will remain warm with the
mid-'60s expected. But the chance for rain the first half of the day will be
high and we could see over one inch! The preliminary look for Thanksgiving Day
is dry and mild. Paul Barys
