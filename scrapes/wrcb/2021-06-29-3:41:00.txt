The center of Tropical Depression Danny (as of 3:30am ET) will pass to the south
of us closer to the Atlanta area this morning. The close pass will bring greater
tropical moisture into our area. First up, clouds will increase for an overall
partly sunny day. Then, we'll have scattered showers and storms from about noon
to 8pm (50%). A few storms may have gusty wind or small hail. It won't be as hot
today with highs around 87 - a little cooler for locations south of Chattanooga
and warmer to the north. Tonight will be partly cloudy with lows from 65-70.

Wednesday will be hotter again in the upper 80s to 90 with afternoon pop-up
showers/storms. Thursday will be partly sunny with highs in the mid-80s - about
88 in Chattanooga. Pop-up storms will occur in the afternoon with increasing
rain for Thursday night. Widespread rainfall - locally heavy - will continue
through the day on Friday. We'll easily receive 1-2" of rainfall with a few
spots at 3". Localized flooding in low-lying areas will be the greatest concern.
Highs will be cooler around 80.

Then, rain chances will diminish on Saturday morning with highs near 84 and
partly sunny. Sunday for the 4th of July holiday will be mostly sunny and 84.
