Good Friday! Rinse and repeat. We have cloudy, humid weather this morning with
temps in the low 70s. A passing shower or two is possible, but it will really be
this afternoon when we see widely scattered thunderstorms moving through. They
will be hit and miss, and the biggest threats will be brief heavy rain and
lightning. We will see a few showers lingering into the evening, but late
evening through the night we will see clearing skies.

Saturday and Sunday will be hot and humid, but we will at least be rain-free
with mostly sunny skies. Highs will reach the low 90s, but it will feel like it
is in the mid 90s.

Monday will also be in the low 90s with more clouds and a very slight chance for
a stray shower.

We will see lower humidity and slightly lower temps the rest of the week with
highs in the upper 80s and lows in the low to mid 60s.
