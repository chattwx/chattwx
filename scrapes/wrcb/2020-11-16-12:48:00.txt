We are going to enjoy some very cool, dry autumn weather for the rest of this
week. I am expecting sunny skies right through this coming Friday. Lows tonight
will be in the mid to upper 30's with some scattered frost. Highs on Tuesday
will be near 60, but northwest winds will make it feel a bit cooler. Tuesday
night will be clear and cool again with scattered frost. Lows should be in the
mid 30's in the city. Wednesday will be cooler with highs in the mid to upper
50's and sunshine. Thursday will be cool with highs in the low 60's and more
sunshine. Friday should be sunny and warmer with highs in the upper 60's.

This coming weekend will see a few changes. Skies will become partly cloudy on
Saturday with highs near 70. Sunday will see the clouds increasing near 70.
There is a chance for some showers to move into the area on Monday with cooler
highs in the low 60's. Paul Barys
