The beautiful, sunny weather will continue for your weekend plans!

Today will be sunny with passing high clouds around lunchtime. It'll be warmer
than the past couple of days but still mild with highs in the low 60s and a
light southerly breeze in the afternoon. Tonight will be clear and not quite as
cold with lows in the mid to upper 30s. Easter Sunday will be sunny with only a
few clouds and very pleasant - highs around 70.

The nice weather trend continues on Monday with a mostly sunny sky and highs
near 74. Tuesday will begin to have more clouds. We'll call it partly cloudy and
75 for the afternoon. Isolated showers will be possible on Wednesday with more
clouds, and it'll be warm in the mid-70s. Thursday will have times of rain and
storms, which will continue overnight into early Friday morning. Highs in the
mid-70s on Thursday and low 70s on Friday. That will be the next weather period
to watch, otherwise enjoy now through Wednesday!
