The coldest air of the season is sliding into the Tennessee Valley. Tonight we
will see snow showers in the higher elevations especially in the Cumberland
Plateau and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Some of the highest elevations will see up
to an inch or 1.5" mainly on the grass and elevated surfaces. In the valley,
amounts will vary between no snow and a half inch north of Chattanooga.
Temperatures will be dropping to near 20 in some spots higher up. Lows in the
valley will be in the mid to upper 20's tonight.

Tuesday will see clearing skies with a west wind and highs in the low 40's.
Tuesday night will see lows in the mid 20's in the valley and upper teens in the
higher elevations. Highs Wednesday will be in the low 50's. A few light rain
showers could develop on Thursday with highs in the low 50's.

Dry weather will continue Friday through next Monday. Highs will be in the 50's.
