Good Thursday. We will see lines of rain, heavy at times moving through until
about 9 pm. Rain totals will range from 1/2" up to an inch with the heavier
amounts being east of Chattanooga.

As we see the front pass through we will dry out and be a little cooler Friday
with temps ranging from 43 to 65. Skies will be sunny all day.

Another weak boundary will pass through late Friday and usher in even colder
weather for the weekend. Saturday we will start at 41, but rebound to only 52
with sunny skies. Sunday will start at 32 with most folks outside the city
dropping into the upper 20s! We will have more clouds moving in Sunday afternoon
with the high making it to 56.

Next week will start cold but we will see some gradual warming through the week.
No rain after today until late next week.
