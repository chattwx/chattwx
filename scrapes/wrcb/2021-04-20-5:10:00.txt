Good Tuesday. We will enjoy a warm one today with highs in the low to mid 70s.
Tree pollen will be an issue again mainly this morning.

A cold front will bring a few light sprinkles to the area early Wednesday
morning, but then we will clear out in the afternoon with much colder and windy
weather settling in. Highs will only be in the mid to upper 50s with winds from
the north at 10-20 mph.

The cold air continues filtering in through Thursday morning. A FREEZE WATCH is
in effect Thursday morning for Sequatchie, Grundy, Bledsoe, and Van Buren County
as well as Cherokee County, NC in the Blue Ridge. Temps will drop into the low
to mid 30s (37 in Chattanooga). I would expect frost in many areas, and freezing
temps in the higher elevations. Thursday afternoon will rebound to a high of 65.

Friday will be cloudy with temps ranging from a cool 44 in the morning to 69 in
the afternoon.

More rain will move through Saturday. It looks like showers will be with us much
of the day. I expect .75"-1.5" of rain. The high will get to 68.

Sunday will be dry and pleasant with a high of 71.
