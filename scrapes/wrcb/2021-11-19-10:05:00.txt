T.G.I.F, Everyone!

The Chill is back! Our Friday afternoon will feature plenty of sunshine, but
cold conditions. Highs will struggle to reach the upper 40s and lower 50s across
the area. Saturday will feature another cold start, with highs once again
rebounding into the mid to upper 50s with plenty of sunshine and a few extra
clouds by the afternoon.

Our next cold front begins to approach the area on Sunday. The first half of the
day will feature increasing clouds and mild temps. Highs should climb into the
upper 50s to near 60. Rain arrives Sunday evening into Sunday night. This system
could provide a quick soaking across the area.

Monday will be a blustery day with clearing skies & very cold air filtering into
the region. Our High temperature will likely occur just after midnight Monday
morning, with temperatures falling throughout the day Monday. Monday night will
feature the coldest air of the season, and likely a hard freeze. Overnight lows
will drop into the 20s area wide. A sun & cloud mix will hang around during the
holiday week with low rain chances possible just after Thanksgiving Day.
Temperatures will remain below normal through the week.

Have a great rest of your Friday!
