Happy Monday, everyone!

It's a sunny but chilly day across the Tennessee Valley. We're expecting plenty
of sunshine this afternoon, but a chilly north wind will help hold highs around
50 degrees today. Tonight, look for clear skies and calm winds. Overnight lows
will bottom out around the freezing mark. Some patchy frost may be possible in
spots.

The rest of this week will feature fairly calm weather conditions. Things will
remain on the sunny & dry side through most of this upcoming week. We are
running a 3" + rainfall deficit this month, so we could use some rain around
these parts.

Temperatures will begin a nice warming trend each day, with high temps peaking
in the upper 60s to around 70 by late-week!

Our next significant weather maker right now is showing up around next weekend
into the following week. This system could bring us some much needed rainfall
and maybe some cooler weather back to the area. Of course, we will keep you
updated on this system as it's still 6-8 days away!

Have a great rest of your Monday!
