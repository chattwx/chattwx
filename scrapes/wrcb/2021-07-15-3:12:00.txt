Good Thursday. No rain tonight. It will be a bit humid, but overall a nice
evening with temps dropping through the 80s.

We wrap up the week with more heat and humidity. The high will reach 91 with the
heat index topping out at about 95. We will see some clouds overhead, but the
rain chance is low. Only one or two showers or storms will break through.

The weekend we will have highs in the mid to upper 80s with better chances for
scattered storms each day mainly in the afternoon. The humidity will remain high
through the weekend.

Next week we will be in the mid-80s with a few afternoon showers and storms at
least through Wednesday.
