Today will be mostly cloudy to cloudy with warm temperatures. Highs will be in
the mid-70s with a southerly breeze at 10-15mph, gusts at 20-30. A few showers
will pop-up during the day, but most locations will stay dry.

Then, tonight is a STORM ALERT WEATHER period for a few reasons. First, there's
a risk for isolated strong to severe storms for areas west of I-75 in Tennessee
and Dade County and westward for Georgia and Alabama. Grundy County especially
needs to stay aware. Second, rain will be heavy at times, potentially causing
flooding. Flood Watches will be in effect for Hamilton, Marion, Sequatchie,
Bledsoe, Rhea, Meigs, Grundy, and Jackson Counties. Third, the event is
happening at night time, so we don't want anyone to be caught off guard. Make
your severe weather plans now. Key timing: 11pm to 5am EST. During this period
expect heavy rain, gusty wind, and lightning. Unfortunately, an isolated tornado
is possible, too. The leading edge of the system will be strongest.

Rain will decrease, becoming light to moderate during the Monday morning commute
time and then fade out through the rest of the day. Monday's official high will
be at midnight in the mid-60s. The daytime high will be cooler around 57.
Tuesday will remain mostly cloudy with a high of 55 and showers mainly in the
afternoon through Wednesday morning. Wednesday will be near 60 with a partly
sunny afternoon.
