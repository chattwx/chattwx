Happy Monday, everyone! It's a much cooler start to our week. Filtered sunshine
will be the rule of the day with high temperatures in the upper 40s to low 50s. 

Tuesday will be mostly cloudy with an isolated shower chance across the south,
and highs in the low 50s again. Wednesday will be mostly sunny with a high near
53. 

Thursday morning will be very cold with many locations in the 20s, but the
afternoon will mark the transition to warming temperatures with highs in the
mid-50s and sunshine.

Christmas Eve on Friday will be partly sunny with highs in the low 60s. We'll
have some scattered showers Friday night into Saturday morning, so keep that in
mind for any church services and Santa! Saturday for Christmas will be mild with
a high of 64 and partly cloudy. 

Have a great rest of your week!
