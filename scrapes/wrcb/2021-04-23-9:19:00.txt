Only a few light showers through 1PM today, and mainly limited to our Tennessee
communities.

Clouds should break briefly this afternoon, giving way to some sunshine. Highs
will reach 67-68Â° today.

Saturday is a Storm Alert Weather Day:

Rain will increase in the morning by 4AM-6AM, and it will be heavy at times.
Smith Perry Berries in Ooltewah will be closed on Saturday, due to heavy rain
expected.

There is also a Marginal Risk for severe weather on Saturday, particularly
Saturday evening where thunderstorms could get to severe strength, producing
hail up to 1" in diameter. Those south in Georgia, could have brief, isolated
damaging wind gusts with the stronger storms, too.

There is not a tornado risk for the TN Valley tomorrow, however, just south near
Atlanta, there is a low threat. Please stay connected tomorrow and track with
us, using the WRCB Weather App.

In the meantime, here's what's safe to plant outdoors starting this weekend.

Seedlings - Bell Peppers, Celery, Cilantro, Oregano, Rosemary, Sage, and Thyme.

Seeds - Corn, Green Beans, and Potatoes.
