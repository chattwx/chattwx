A Winter Weather Advisory is valid for Grundy county tonight beginning at 9PM
CST until 12PM CST Saturday morning. Minor snow accumulation of 1" to 2" will be
possible through Saturday morning, limiting visibility, and creating slick
roads. Be advised if you are traveling late tonight or early Saturday.

A dusting will be possible across the valley early Saturday morning. While there
is only one county currently in the Winter Weather Advisory, things could
change. Please monitor the weather through tomorrow.

I've also added in a chance for mountain flurries for Sunday. It will certainly
be a cold January weekend for the Tennessee Valley, as highs stay below normal
in the low to mid 40s in the afternoons.

Today: enjoy this sunshine for the next few hours. Clouds will roll in by
afternoon, and increase tonight.

TODAY:

12PM: M. Sunny, 45

3PM: P. Cloudy, gusty winds at times, 50

6PM: Increasing Clouds, 43
