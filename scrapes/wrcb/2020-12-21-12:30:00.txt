Skies will be clearing tonight, just in time for the grand conjunction of
Jupiter and Saturn in the western sky after sunset. Lows will be in the mid to
upper 30's. We will see more sunshine for Tuesday with highs in the upper 50's.
Tuesday night will see more high clouds moving in with lows in the mid-'30s.
Wednesday will see a gradual increase in cloud cover and by midnight or after we
will see some rain move into the Tennessee Valley. We may see over an inch of
rain. Wind will be brisk on Wednesday with gusts to 25 mph out of the south.

Thursday will see rain in the morning changing over to some sleet and snow as
temperatures fall from the mid to upper 40's and into the 30's by afternoon.
Amounts will be highest in the higher elevations with just a dusting in the
valleys of Tennessee and North Georgia. By Friday morning (Christmas Day) lows
will be in the low 20's and highs only in the mid-'30s.

Saturday and Sunday will be dry and cold with highs in the '40s to near 50 and
