Happy Tuesday, everyone! After some of the coldest temperatures of the season so
far, things are slowly trying to warm up with plenty of sunshine. This afternoon
will feature mostly sunny skies and high temps warming into the upper 40s to
around 50.

Get ready for another cold evening & night around the region. This evening,
temps will quickly drop into the 30s after sunset, and thing will fall into the
20s after midnight. Another Hard Freeze will be likely moving into Wednesday
morning.

Changes arrive for our Wednesday, with a mix of clouds and sunshine, but a south
wind should bring slightly warmer air back to the area. Highs on Wednesday will
climb into the mid to upper 50s.

Our next cold front approaches the area for Thanksgiving Day. Right now,
Thursday will be mainly dry with clouds on the increase. Temperatures will also
warm near 60 ahead of our next cold blast. Rain chances arrive from west to east
between 4pm and 7pm Thursday. A period of showers will be likely Thursday
evening as the front blows thru.

Friday will feature clearing skies, and blustery conditions. Morning temps will
be in the 30s with daytime highs only climbing into the 40s.

The weekend looks dry with a mix of clouds and sunshine, and cold mornings in
the 30s but mild afternoons with highs back into the mid 50s.

Stay warm this afternoon!
