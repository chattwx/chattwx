Saturday will start okay with temps in the low to mid-60s. Throughout the day,
however, the humidity and the temperature will be a little higher. We will climb
to about 90 with the heat index in the low to mid-90s. We may get a stray
sprinkle or two, but I am keeping the rain chance at only 10%.

Sunday will be another hot and muggy one with the high reaching 91. We may get a
few scattered storms in the afternoon. The chance for rain, again, is only 10%

Monday will see the high reaching a muggy 92! The heat index will be about 96.
Skies through the day will be mostly sunny.

The rest of the week will fall into a typical summer pattern. Highs will be in
the upper 80s. Humidity will stay pretty high. And each afternoon we may get a
few storms popping up with the heat of the day.
