Clouds have been slow to show any signs of breaking today, but some locations
are getting a bit of blue sky. Unfortunately, if you live in Chattanooga to
Cleveland to Dayton the low level clouds will continue to persist, only breaking
slightly for peeks of blue sky this evening. These clouds have kept temperatures
cooler. Depending on your location, it'll be in the low 60s to upper 50s for
Saturday evening.

We continue to Storm Alert for the rest of Saturday as scattered showers and
storms will move across our area from about 6-11pm EDT. This is a low-end risk
event for an isolated severe storm to form. The hazards are hail and strong,
gusty winds. Storms should be done by 11pm, but a few residual showers will last
past midnight, mainly in the eastern mountains. Lows tonight will be from 45-50.

Sunday will be a much nicer day! Clouds will clear through the day with highs in
the upper 60s to low 70s with wind from the north at 5-10 mph. Monday will be
warmer around 80 and sunny with only a stray cloud. Tuesday will have high
clouds and in the low 80s - 84 in Chattanooga. Wednesday will be partly sunny to
mostly cloudy with highs near 82. Thursday will be mostly cloudy in the upper
70s to 80. Scattered showers will develop later in the day and carry into Friday
morning. Friday afternoon will become partly sunny with highs in the low 70s.
