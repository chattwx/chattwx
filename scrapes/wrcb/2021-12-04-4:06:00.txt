Happy Saturday! After a chilly start, another quick warm-up is expected as highs
reach around 70 degrees this afternoon. Skies will range from mostly cloudy to
overcast throughout much of the day. A few light sprinkles will be possible this
afternoon into the overnight hours.

Skies will remain mostly cloudy on Sunday with temperatures a few degrees
colder. A few light showers will be around during the day with a better chance
of widespread rain arriving Sunday night.

A more active pattern will settle in next week. Showers will develop Monday
morning along a cold front before tapering off later in the day. Colder
temperatures will settle in behind the front Tuesday, as highs struggle to push
out of the upper-40s. Another round of showers will be possible late Tuesday
into Wednesday as another storm system brings moisture into the area.

Thursday and Friday will remain mostly cloudy, with a few showers possible
Friday afternoon.

There is quite a bit of inconsistency between forecast models for the middle of
the week, so be sure to download the WRCB weather app for the latest updates!
