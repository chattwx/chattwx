Thursday morning will be warm and muggy with increasing clouds. Then, starting
up around noon, we'll be entering into an active weather period for about 24
hours. Scattered showers and storms will progressively increase through the
afternoon, becoming more widespread for the evening hours. Pockets of rain will
then continue overnight into Friday morning. Friday's morning commute is
trending in a better direction with it no longer being widespread heavy rain,
instead the system looks to be moving faster. Thus, driving on Friday morning,
you may hit a heavy downpour, but it won't be experienced by everyone. We'll
keep you informed if this trend continues. The bulk of rain/storms will be done
by about 1pm on Friday. Totaling 1-2" for most.

Then, it's nice weather time! Clouds will break on Friday afternoon with highs
near 83. Saturday will be sunny with lower humidity and highs from 80-85. The
fantastic summer weather will continue on Sunday with highs in the mid to upper
80s. Monday will be hot in the low 90s and mostly sunny. All days of the 4th of
July holiday weekend will be great for boating, barbeques, pool time, etc., and
nights will be warm and clear for fireworks.
