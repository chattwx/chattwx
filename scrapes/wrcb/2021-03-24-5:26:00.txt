Good Wednesday. Today will be warm and mostly cloudy with highs in the mid 70s.
We may get a sprinkle here and there.

Thursday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. We will start with heavy rain for the
morning commute. Scattered thunderstorms will develop during the afternoon into
tomorrow night. Some of the storms late tomorrow into early Friday morning have
a good chance of becoming severe.

The Storm Prediction Center breaks down the threat risk as follows:

Damaging winds 15% to 30%
Hail 5% to 15%

Tornadoes 5% to 10%

The risk percentages increase the further west you go.

We can also expect 1"-2" of rain Thursday into Friday morning.

The risk for severe storms will last until the front slides through around 3am
Friday. The rest of the day will be great with sunshine and temps in the mid
70s.

We will see more rain and a few storms Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning.
