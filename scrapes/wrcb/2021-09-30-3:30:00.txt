Good Thursday. The dry weather continues through most of Sunday with partly
cloudy skies, lows in the low to mid 60s, and highs in the mid 80s. We will
remain a touch humid through Saturday as well. There is a slight chance for a
few showers east of Chattanooga Saturday afternoon.

Sunday a front approaching will push in scattered showers late Sunday evening
into Sunday night. We will continue to see showers and a few thunderstorms on
and off through the day Monday. The high Monday will only make it to 75.

We will continue to see scattered on and off showers and storms through
Thursday. All next week we will have highs in the low to mid 70s with lows in
the low 60s. The humidity will slowly be dropping next week also.

Right now it looks like we will be rain-free and have another burst of cooler
fall air by NEXT weekend.
