Good Monday, and happy MLK Day! You couldn't ask for better for a day off in
January. Mostly sunny skies with highs in the low 50s this afternoon.

Skies will be cloudy through the first part of the day Tuesday, and we will be a
little colder in the morning with temps in the low 30s. Tuesday afternoon it
will clear out, and we should return to the low 50s.

I expect much the same Wednesday with temps ranging from 36 to 53.

Thursday we may get some rain showers through the day, but some model data is
showing us getting about 1/2" of rain through the day, other model data has all
the rain staying to our south, and us getting no rain at all. We will have to
wait another day as more data comes in to be able to have more confidence on
what will happen Thursday.

Friday will be mostly cloudy. We will start in the low 40s, and climb to the low
50s.
