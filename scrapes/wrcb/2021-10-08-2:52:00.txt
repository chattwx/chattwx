Good Friday! We will have amazing weather this evening with mostly clear skies
and temps in the low 70s most of the evening. No problems for the Friday night
football games.

The weekend will be excellent. Prater's Mill Country Fair is this weekend so
grab the family and be outdoors as much as you can. Saturday looks great with
temps from 60 in the morning to 82 and mostly sunny in the afternoon. Sunday
will be nice as well with a few clouds and temps ranging from 62 to 82.

Next week will remain about the same through Thursday. Lows each day will be in
the low to mid-60s. Highs will be in the low 80s. Skies will remain mostly sunny
to partly cloudy.

A front will move through NEXT Friday and may bring a few rain showers, but more
importantly much cooler air for next weekend. Stay tuned for some true fall air.
