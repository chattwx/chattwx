Good Tuesday. We are dealing with some areas of heavy fog this morning with Fog
Advisories in effect for Polk, McMinn, and Cherokee counties. Temps are a little
cooler in the low 30s this morning. We will be mild and nice this afternoon with
partly cloudy skies and highs in the low to mid-50s. Wednesday will be nice also
with temps ranging from 42 in the morning to 56 in the afternoon. Clouds will be
increasing throughout the day.

Thursday will be very warm. 49 in the morning and 61 in the afternoon.
Throughout the day we may get a few light sprinkles. However, we will see more
widespread scattered showers late Thursday night into Friday morning which will
mean a good shot of rain as you ring in the new year. Temps at midnight will be
in the mid to upper 50s.

We have a shot of having record rain for the year. So far we have seen 72.62".
The record (1994) is 73.70". To break the record we will have to get 1.08" of
rain before midnight. Right now that looks unlikely. We will get up to 1/2"
Thursday night. Friday, however, we will add another 1" to 2" to that throughout
the day. The timing of the rain moving through will determine if we break the
record.

After the rain moves through we will have an awesome first weekend of 2021. It
will be dry with highs in the 50s.
