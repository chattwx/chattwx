A strong storm system is developing out to the west of us today and tonight.
This will keep us in a cloudy pattern with the chance for showers and even
storms (some strong to severe) increasing into the end of the week. We are
calling Thursday and early Friday morning Storm Alert days. This is to give you
a heads up that we may be encountering some severe storms along with a
possibility of tornadoes for that time. Make sure you have an action plan where
you live, so you can implement it immediately if ever a tornado warning is
issued for your area!

Showers will end tonight with lows in the mid 50's. Clouds will cover the skies
on Wednesday and highs will be in the low 70's with a southerly breeze. A few
showers may develop late Wednesday night with lows in the upper 50's. Thursday
will see showers and storms with highs in the mid 70's. Some of the storms will
be strong to severe with possible tornadoes. The storms will continue overnight
and end on early Friday morning. Highs will still be in the 70's.

More showers are expected back on Saturday with highs in the 70's. Showers and
storms will be possible Sunday and again on Monday. So there is a good chance we
will see some flooding over the next 7 days. Paul Barys
