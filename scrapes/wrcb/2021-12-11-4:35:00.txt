Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day. You need to be weather aware Saturday
morning through afternoon. Key Timing: 8am to 3pm ET from west to east. Now is
the time to prepare. Make sure you have multiple ways to receive weather
notifications and know where your safe shelter is. Reach out to family and
friends to make sure they're aware.

SUMMARY:

Our entire area is under either a Level 2 Slight risk or Level 1 Marginal risk

possible. The line of storms will move from W to E, producing heavy rain,
damaging wind gusts, and potentially isolated tornadoes along the leading edge.
This system has a history of wind damage and tornadoes. A TORNADO WATCH is in

DeKalb, and Jackson Counties until 12pm/11am CT. Wind Advisories are also in

General timing is 8am-3pm for the strongest storms. Rain showers will continue
