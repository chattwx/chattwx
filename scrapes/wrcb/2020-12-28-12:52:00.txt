The weather pattern will remain quiet for the Tennessee Valley for much of this
week. I am expecting mostly cloudy to cloudy skies for tonight, Tuesday and
Wednesday. Highs for Tuesday will be in the mid-'50s and that pattern will
repeat on Wednesday. Thursday will see some scattered showers moving in, but
amounts will be light. Highs will be warmer and in the low 60's. Overnight
Thursday night will turn wet with the rain ending on Friday afternoon and
evening. Amounts will range between one and two inches. Highs will be near 70. A
few thunderstorms will be possible, too.

Saturday will be mostly cloudy with showers developing late Saturday night.
Amounts should be light. Highs will be in the upper 50's. Sunday will see the
showers end in the morning with highs near 50. Paul Barys
