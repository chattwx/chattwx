Rain showers will taper off by 4 AM Monday, and a surge of colder, drier air
will settle into the area. Temperatures will hold steady in the 40s for most of
the day with a breezy northerly wind making it feel even colder. Overnight lows
will drop into the mid to upper-20s under mostly clear skies.

Tuesday and Wednesday will feature cold mornings with below-freezing
temperatures and chilly afternoons in the low to mid-50. Skies will generally
remain sunny with a few clouds returning Wednesday afternoon.

Our next chance of rain will arrive on Thanksgiving day as another cold front
approaches the region. It looks like the best time frame for showers will be
during the late afternoon into the early evening hours. Behind the cold front,
another shot of cold air will settle in for your weekend!
