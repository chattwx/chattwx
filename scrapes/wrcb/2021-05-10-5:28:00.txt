Good Monday. We are starting out this morning warm (60s) and overcast with a few
remnant drizzles possible until noon. During the afternoon we may see a little
clearing, but we will still have our fair share of clouds with the high making
it to the low 70s.

Tuesday looks great. We will be a little cooler in the morning in the low 50s,
and the afternoon will sport mostly sunny skies and highs again in the low 70s.

Around midnight heading into Wednesday morning we will see some passing rain
showers that will end around 6am. the rest of Wednesday should be dry and cool
with a high of only 69.

Thursday we can expect scattered showers on and off all day with temps ranging
from 50 to 69.

Friday will be super with a low of 49 and a high of 73 with sunny skies.

The weekend looks good with warmer weather coming back. We will hit 76 Saturday
and 80 by Sunday.
