Good Monday. As we honor and remember on this Memorial Day we will have
agreeable weather throughout. Skies today will be mostly sunny to partly cloudy
with highs in the low 80s.

Tuesday starts the month of June. It looks good also with some late-day clouds
and temps ranging from 58 in the morning to 84 in the afternoon.

Wednesday will be dry, but mostly cloudy with the humidity increasing quite.
Highs will remain in the low 80s.

Thursday and Friday we will sport highs around 80 with scattered showers and
thunderstorms possible both afternoons.

I expect more of the same this weekend. We will be humid, but temps will make it
tolerable as highs stay in the low 80s. We will likely have more spotty showers
and storms during the afternoon and evening hours.
