Good Monday. Cool and dry weather will start us off this week with clear skies
and cool temps. Tonight we will drop into the low to mid-20s, 27 in Chattanooga.
Tuesday afternoon we will only be able to rebound to a high of 45. Wednesday
will be another sunny and chilly one with temps ranging from 28 to 51.

Thursday will again reach 51 with mostly cloudy skies and a VERY slight chance
for a few mountain flurries Thursday.

Friday will be cloudy through the day. We will start in the low 30s and make it
to only 49 in the afternoon.

Saturday a system will dive sown from the north bringing rain showers Saturday
afternoon with highs in the low to mid-40s. As temps cool through the evening
into Saturday night we may see that transitioning some into a wintry mix that
could last into early Sunday morning. Temps Sunday morning will be in the upper
20s and low 30s. There is still a bit of uncertainty surrounding this system so
stay tuned for the next several days. I'm sure we'll tweak it quite a bit this
week.

Sunday afternoon into Monday will be cold with highs only in the low 40s and
lows dropping back into the 20s Monday morning.
