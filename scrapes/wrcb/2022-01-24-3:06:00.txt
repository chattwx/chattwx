Good morning, overall, this week will have quiet weather with most days
featuring at or below normal temperatures. Today will be the warmest. It'll
begin cold, but it'll warm up to 54 for the high with plentiful sunshine.
Overnight, clouds will be on the increase with lows in the mid-30s.

Tuesday will have more clouds, especially in the morning, with highs in the
upper 40s to 50. There will be a small chance for a spotty shower. Wednesday
will be mostly sunny again with chilly highs in the low 40s. Thursday will have
a mix of sun and clouds and range from 20s in the morning to upper 40s in the
afternoon. Friday will be mostly cloudy with highs near 44. A cold front will
sweep through bringing a chance for isolated rain and snow showers, and of
course, a drop in temperatures heading into the weekend. Saturday will begin in
the low 20s and top out at only 39. At least, it'll be mostly sunny. After a
cold morning, Sunday afternoon will rebound to near 50.
