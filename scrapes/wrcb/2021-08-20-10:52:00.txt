Mostly cloudy skies for your Friday with high temperatures in the low to
mid-80s. It will be muggy outside, so even though the temps aren't too warm, our
heat index will reach around 90 today. Friday afternoon will feature scattered
showers and storms that will last through the evening until about 10pm tonight.
If you have a Friday Night Football game to attend, it's best to bring a towel
to wipe off seats and a raincoat just in case. Hopefully, all the storms will
dodge games, but with lightning, a couple of games may be delayed this evening.
Temperatures will be comfortable for gametime in the low 80s to upper 70s.

Saturday will have similar weather with highs in the mid-80s, scattered storms
again, and a mostly cloudy sky. Storms will be more prevalent for Chattanooga
and southwest. Sunday will be the better day of the weekend for consistent
outdoor plans with only a few isolated storms. There will also be more sunshine
with highs in the upper 80s to 90.

Highs in the low 90s for Monday and Tuesday with very minimal rain chances.
Wednesday will have some showers and still hot around 90.
