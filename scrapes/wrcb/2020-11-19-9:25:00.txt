It officially dropped to 32 this morning in Chattanooga, making it the coldest
morning so far of Fall 2020!

Highs today will reach 60-62, while winds will be gusting 20-25 at times,
especially for those near Altamont, Monteagle, and Dayton-making today not the
best afternoon to be raking leaves.

Nights won't be as cold starting Friday night-with lows returning to the 40s. It
stays clear however, to see the Waxing Crescent Moon with neighbors Saturn and
Jupiter nearby in the night sky. Look to the south/southwest to see the nice
trio. The moon will be setting later tonight, too, just bundle up!

We have one more cold morning, with temperatures in the upper 30s Friday morning
for the bus stop.

The weekend will be dry. A chance for rain moves in Sunday night through the wee
morning hours Monday, bringing only 0.01" to 0.20" during this time. A better
rain chance arrives on Wednesday, where widespread 1" to 2" is looking possible
for the biggest travel day.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunny and Cool, 56

3PM: Sunny and Cool, Breezy at times, 61

6PM: Clear and Cool, 55
