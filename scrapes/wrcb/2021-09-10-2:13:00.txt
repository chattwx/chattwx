Good Friday!! Well, I feel spoiled. The weather has been "chamber of commerce"
for sure and looks to continue the trend through the weekend.

Tonight, no problems for Friday Night Football, Nightfall, or anything else
going on. Temps will fall through the 70s with clear skies and low humidity.

Saturday is perfect for all the great events, weddings, lawn work, or whatever
your Saturday finds you doing. We start in the upper 50s with low humidity and
sunshine. We will be a bit warmer with the high reaching 86, but it will still
feel nice with sunshine all day long.

Sunday will also be warm and sunny with a high of 89. The humidity may be just a
bit higher, but it will still be a pretty nice day.

We start next week hot with highs around 90. The humidity will be higher, but
not too oppressive.

We will get a few scattered showers and storms by the middle of the week.

Today marks the peak of hurricane season. There are two systems we are watching
in the tropics with the potential to develop, neither of which are an immediate
threat to the Tennessee Valley.
