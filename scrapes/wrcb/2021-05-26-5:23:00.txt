Good Morning,

The partial eclipse will be briefly visible in Chattanooga from 5:44AM until
6:11AM. Moonset is at 6:34AM. Therefore, by the time it's a total full eclipse,
the moon will be below the horizon.

It will be difficult to see in the valley due to ridges blocking the way.
Lookout Mountain and Signal Mountain folks will have an opportunity to see a
slither of the moon shaded out.

We're onto the 4th consecutive day in a row in the 90s..again! Some folks
actually got some measurable rainfall yesterday, too. Murphy and Blue Ridge
picked up ~0.70" yesterday - the first time in 2 weeks.

It will be warm and humid for the Lookouts game this evening, with an isolated
shower possible by 11PM or so.

We're keeping an eye on Friday - as there is a Marginal Risk for severe weather
from 5PM to 10PM. A Marginal Risk means, there is a potential for a strong storm
or two during this period.
