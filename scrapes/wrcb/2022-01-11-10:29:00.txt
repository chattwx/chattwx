Happy Tuesday, everyone! We're enjoying another day with plenty of sunshine
across the region. Look for sunny skies this afternoon with high temperatures
warming into the mid to upper 40s. Tonight, mostly clear skies return with cold
temperatures. We will see our overnight lows bottoming out in the 20s again.

Wednesday will feature mostly sunny skies a bit warmer. High temperatures will
warm into the 50s. A mix of clouds and sunshine returns Thursday with just a
slight chance for a sprinkle or two. Highs again warm into the 50s.

Partly cloudy & cooler on Friday with highs only in the 40s.

An interesting weekend weather forecast is on tap for the area. A strong area of
low pressure dives south into the region on Saturday bringing a chance for Rain
& Snow. Still plenty of questions to iron out with this system, but it's
definitely one to watch in the coming days!

Have a great Tuesday!
