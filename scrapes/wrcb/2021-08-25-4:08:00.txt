The above normal, hot temperatures will continue today. Most locations will
begin the day already warm in the 70s, hitting the mid-80s by noon, and then
afternoon highs from 90-94. Peak heat index values will be in the upper 90s to
100. It'll be a mostly sunny day with isolated storms this afternoon/evening,
mainly across the higher elevations. Tonight will be partly cloudy with lows in
the upper 60s to low 70s.

Thursday will be partly sunny with scattered showers/storms primarily in the
afternoon and early evening. Highs won't be as hot in the upper 80s. Friday will
be mostly sunny with highs near 90 and only an isolated shower chance. Saturday
and Sunday should be similar with highs in the upper 80s with scattered PM
storms each day.

Rain chances will then increase at the beginning of next work-week ahead of an
approaching frontal boundary and a potential tropical system. Something to
especially watch Tuesday and Wednesday, but a lot can change between now and
then.
