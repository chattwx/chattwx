For today, once again, it starts with areas of patchy dense fog. It'll last
until about 10am, primarily affecting valleys and along waterways. The rest of
Thursday will be partly cloudy with warm highs. In fact, if you enjoy warm
temperatures, you just have today and tomorrow before a cold front passes early
Saturday morning, ushering in cooler fall air. Highs both days will be from
80-84. The first part of Friday will be quiet and dry. Then, a few scattered
showers will be possible in the afternoon to evening, especially NW of
Chattanooga. The main rain event will arrive overnight with a narrow line along
the cold front. Rain will be done for our eastern counties by 9am Saturday.
Total rainfall at 0.1-.25".

Then, it's all about fall enjoyment! Skies will clear for the rest of Saturday
for a sunny afternoon with highs only in the mid-60s, a northwest breeze, and
falling humidity. Sunday will begin in the low to mid-40s with highs in the
mid-60s and sunny. Monday will have some high thin clouds mixed with sunshine
and again range from 40s to upper 60s-70. Tuesday will be a bit warmer with
highs in the low 70s under a mostly sunny sky.
