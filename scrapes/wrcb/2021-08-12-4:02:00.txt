Good Thursday. While we may still see an isolated storm or two popping up this
evening (the best chance would be on the plateau west of Chattanooga) it will
overall be fairly quiet. Clouds this morning as well as high pressure building
in kept the atmosphere pretty stable. Temps this evening will fall through the
upper to low 80s under partly cloudy skies.

Friday will be another hot, muggy one with highs in the low 90s and the heat
index in the upper 90s. We will likely see a few spotty storms that could become
strong. Saturday will be pretty much the same.

Sunday we will have a front stalled to our south that could go one of two ways.
If it is far enough north we will have heavy rain Sunday afternoon and night. If
it stays a bit south we will only have spotty showers and storms. Highs will be
in the upper 80s.

Monday we will likely see increased moisture from TS Fred which will keep our
rain chances high through the day. Tuesday through Friday we will settle into a
pattern that is a bit cooler and slightly less humid. Highs will be in the mid
80s. We will still see some spotty showers and storms each afternoon.
