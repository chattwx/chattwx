Good Morning, 

While it has rained nearly every day for the last 10 days, turns out, the 2.96"
since the first of the month is a little behind! It's â€“ 0.08" below normal since
July 1st.

However, the rainy pattern will continue through Tuesday, with coverage lowering
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Expect rain today and tonight, where areas in Alabama and Georgia will get 1" to
2", possibly near 3" by tomorrow evening, and our Tennessee communities getting
0.50" to 1" through tomorrow. 

Temperatures will stay in the 70s both today and Tuesday, too, before reaching
the mid 80s by Wednesday. I don't see temperatures heating back to the 90s until
the end of the week, so despite the humidity, at least temperatures remain below
normal through Thursday!

TODAY:

12PM: On and off showers, 74

3PM: On and off showers, 77

6PM: Briefly drying out, 79
