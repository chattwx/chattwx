Once again bundle up for the morning hours with temperatures near or below
freezing for your Tuesday. A little river valley fog has developed, but most of
the area has great visibility as you head into work or school. However, you'll
probably still need a couple of extra minutes to warm up your car or scrape
frost of the windshield. We'll have another pleasant afternoon with highs in the
low 60s with a sunny sky. Overnight will have a few clouds and lows from 35-40.

Wednesday will be a mostly sunny day with highs in the low 60s. The mild weather
continues on Thursday at 66 with a mostly cloudy sky. Friday will be warm in the
upper 60s to 70, but there will also be scattered rain showers. Saturday should
have the greatest rain chances with highs near 68. After Saturday, there is
disagreement on how much rain if any to expect for Sunday and Monday. Right now,
I'm leaving in a few scattered showers for both days, but that may change as we
get closer. Temperatures will be a little cooler with highs back in the 50s.
