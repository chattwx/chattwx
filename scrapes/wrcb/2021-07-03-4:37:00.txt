Sunny skies, low humidity, and comfortable temperatures topping out in the
mid-80s will make for a spectacular Saturday across the Tennessee Valley.
Temperatures will fall back into the lower 60s tonight as skies remain clear.

Temperatures will bounce back to near 90 tomorrow, but there will be plenty of
sunshine around for your Fourth of July festivities. We will cool back into the
80s tomorrow evening as you head out to enjoy local firework displays across the
area. Overall, I would give our Fourth of July weekend a 10 out of 10!

Conditions will remain dry to kick off our upcoming work week. The heat and
humidity will return as highs range from 88-94 degrees Monday and Tuesday.
Moisture will increase by the middle of the week, and afternoon rain chances
will return Wednesday through Friday.

We are also tracking Hurricane Elsa through the Caribbean this weekend. Impacts
could begin in the Florida Peninsula as early as Monday evening. The Tennessee
Valley could receive rain from Hurricane Elsa by the middle of the week
depending on the storm track. Be sure to download our weather app for the latest
