After a cold morning in the 30s, it looks like a very nice afternoon is on tap,
with a few high clouds increasing today, and especially tonight. Highs should
reach 60-62 today.

Wednesday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. While isolated showers are possible
Wednesday afternoon, a line of thunderstorms will be rolling in Wednesday night,
mainly after 7PM through 1AM Thursday morning. Brief heavy rain, lightning, and
isolated damaging wind gusts, leading to a few power outages will be possible.
It's important to stay connected, download a weather app, and ensure
notifications are selected "on" in settings on your phone, in case of a warning.

Thanksgiving Day will be splendid, though! Mild temperatures 8-12 above normal
near 70-71 with increasing sun during the day. It looks great for early shoppers
on Black Friday, too with highs in the upper 60s.

Rain will arrive again Friday night late, after 8PM through Saturday
morning-best chance over Georgia counties.

TODAY:

12PM: M. Sunny, 52

3PM: High clouds increasing, 60

6PM: P. Cloudy, 56
