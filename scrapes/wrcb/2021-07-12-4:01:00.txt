We'll begin the work-week with small, sporadic showers in the morning. These
showers shouldn't cause any problems, and a lot of locations will stay dry.
Then, after 2pm, scattered showers and storms will increase. These scattered
storms will last until the evening, and similar to yesterday, they'll feature
heavy downpours, lightning, and brief gusty wind. Our biggest concern will be
for the potential of localized flooding, especially in locations that received
heavy rain yesterday (Meigs & Marion Counties). On average, 0.25-0.75" of
rainfall today, locally 1-1.5" with stronger repeated storms. Today's
temperatures will stay below normal with highs from 80-85 and overnight lows in
the upper 60s.

Tuesday will be another active day with scattered showers and storms. Highs will
be near 85 with a partly sunny sky in between showers. Wednesday should have a
slight break from the rain with a 30% chance for scattered showers and warmer
highs near 88. Then finally on Thursday, most locations should remain dry with
highs in the upper 80s, more sunshine, and only an isolated shower chance. Rain
will then increase again for Friday heading into the weekend.
