Today will have increasing clouds through the morning, becoming mostly cloudy
for lunch and early afternoon. Then, clouds will decrease again for the evening.
It'll mainly be dry. There will be a few isolated light showers/sprinkles,
particularly for areas west of I-75. These will be more of a nuisance than truly
causing any issues for outdoor plans. If you do get stuck under a brief shower,
rainfall should only be a trace amount. Highs today will be comfortable in the
upper 60s to low 70s with a westerly breeze at 5-10mph.

Tonight will have increasing clouds after midnight with lows from 50-54 for
most. Mother's Day on Sunday will have more sun in the morning with clouds
increasing again for the afternoon. It'll be warm around 80 with wind from the
south at 10-15mph and gusts at 20-30. Most of the daytime will be dry with
scattered showers starting up at about 4pm/3pm CT in the west. Then, more
significant rain/storms will move through from about 8pm to 3am.

Rain will generally fade out Monday morning with a mostly cloudy sky and highs
in the low 70s. It now looks like the main rain system will stay south of our
area on Tuesday and Wednesday with scattered showers on Thursday. Highs will be
cooler those days in the mid-60s to 70.
