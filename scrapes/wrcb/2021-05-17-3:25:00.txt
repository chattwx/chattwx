Good Monday afternoon. Skies will remain mostly cloudy, but it feels great
outside. This evening we will drop through the 70s.

The big deal this week will be the rising temps. The average high this time of
year is 81. We will hit that Tuesday with clouds and a VERY slight chance for a
sprinkle. We will also be a little breezy with winds from the SE at 10-15 mph.

Wednesday and Thursday we should enjoy a little more sunshine as we inch up to
85.

Friday will be mostly sunny, but we will flirt with 90 as we climb to 89 in the
afternoon.

Saturday and Sunday will see us making it to the low 90s. This will be the first
time we have been in the 90s since the middle of September. Saturday we will hit
92. The record high for Saturday is 96. Sunday we will hit 93, and that would
tie the record previously set in 1953! We will have some clouds but will be dry
through the weekend.

I expect the low 90s to hang around until at least the middle of next week.
