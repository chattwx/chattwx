Sunday will feel like early January, staying in the 40s with a westerly breeze.
There'll be a few sprinkles Sunday morning that may transition to spitting
snowflakes/flurries in the higher elevations until noon, particularly to the
northwest of Chattanooga. No impacts are expected. Clouds will slowly decreasing
through the day from mostly cloudy in the morning to partly cloudy later in the
afternoon. Overnight will have some clouds with temperatures dropping to around
freezing Monday morning.

Monday will be mostly sunny with highs near 54. A mix of sun and clouds on
Tuesday with a spotty light shower chance and a high of 55. Wednesday will have
high thin clouds and reach the low 50s. Then scattered rain showers develop on
Thursday with highs near 50. Friday will be cooler, only in the mid-40s, and
scattered showers will continue with a little wintry mix in the mountains. The
exact timing and amount of rain for Thursday and Friday will depend on the track
of a Low pressure system whether it is over our area or to the south.
