The rest of Saturday will be mostly sunny and pleasantly in the upper 60s to low
70s. Sunset comes early at 5:35pm followed by falling temps through the 60s with
high thin clouds streaming by. It should be a great night to be outside.
Overnight, clouds will slowly increase, along with the wind. Lows will be milder
around 54.

Showers will move across our area from west to east from about 7am to 1pm EST on
Sunday morning associated with a cold front. During this time, it'll be breezy
with wind gusts up to 30mph in the valley and 40-50mph in the highest
elevations. Total rainfall will be a Trace to 0.25". Once the front passes,
clouds will clear for Sunday afternoon sunshine. It'll still be breezy from the
northwest and highs will be in the mid-60s in the early afternoon. Do expect a
cool Sunday evening to end your weekend.

The highlights for the work week will be sunshine, dry weather, and cooler
temperatures. Monday through Thursday will be sunny with highs from 58-62 and
lows in the mid-30s to 40. Friday and Saturday will be a little warmer in the
mid-60s with only a few clouds.
