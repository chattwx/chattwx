Good Wednesday afternoon! Itâ€™s a cloudy but very warm day across the area. High
temperatures are nearing the 60 degree mark in many locations. Look for clouds
to continue to thicken this evening, with rain becoming steady & likely by late
this evening and overnight. Some of the rainfall could be locally heavy at
times.

The rain will begin to come to an end by early Thursday morning, but any
leftover moisture could turn into some freezing drizzle or a few flurries. This
will not be a big event, but it only takes a glaze of ice to cause some problems
in the higher elevations. Thursday will be a cold & blustery day around the
area. Temperatures will likely hold steady in the 30s with a biting NW wind.

Friday will feature more clouds across the region, with a slight chance for a
few flurries or a snow shower, especially across eastern areas. Otherwise, look
for another very cold day with highs only in the 20s and 30s.

Right now, the weekend is looking dry & quiet with a mix of clouds and sunshine
and highs in the 40s & lows in the 20s.

Have a great Wednesday night!
