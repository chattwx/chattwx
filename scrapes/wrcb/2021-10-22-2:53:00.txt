Good Friday! We have perfect fall weather in store for the ball games tonight.
Temps will be cooling through the 50s under clearing skies during the game. More
fog will develop overnight as we see temps falling back into the low to mid-40s.
Saturday will be awesome with lots of sunshine and highs in the upper 60s and
low 70s.

Sunday we will be under a warm front that will allow south winds to crank the
highs into the upper 70s. Skies will have a sun/cloud mix.

A front will move through and bring scattered showers to the area Monday. We
will dry out and cool to the upper 60s for highs Tuesday.

Another front will bring in more widespread rain and thunderstorms Wednesday
afternoon into Wednesday night.

A few showers may linger into Thursday, but we should be drying out and cooling
back down by the end of next week. 66 will be the high Thursday, and only 60 for
the high Friday!
