The mild air is with us still this evening. Clouds will increase lifting from
the south, and northward. Lows tonight will be cooler, but still 10 -12 above
normal, in the mid 40s overnight.

Rain will return late tonight, starting light, around 2AM-3AM.

Wednesday morning's drive time will be wet, especially for Georgia and Alabama
in the morning. Thunderstorms are not expected with this event.

There will be a break in the rain on Wednesday, before a strong cold front moves
in by evening. This front will bring some brief winter weather, but enough to be
a nuisance on the roads. The start up time for winter precip looks to be around
5PM-7PM with flurries overnight into Thursday morning. Due to how mild
temperatures have been over the last 36 hours, road temperatures should be good
enough, where snow accumulation won't stick-just enough to cause slippery roads.

By Thursday and Friday mornings, we'll be reminded, old man winter is still with
us. The wind chill both Thursday and Friday mornings, will be in the low 20s!
Brr!
