Good Monday. We are in for a cool and cloudy evening with temps falling through
the low 40s. You will certainly want the jacket for your evening stroll.

Tuesday will remain chilly and cloudy with temps ranging from 37 to 51. there is
a very slight chance for a drop or two of rain on the windshield, but I wouldn't
bet the ranch on it. Tuesday is also the first day of Winter which will
officially be here at 11:59 am Tuesday.

Wednesday and Thursday the sunshine returns. Temps remain cool with lows in the
low 30s and highs in the low 50s.

Friday is Christmas Eve and it will also mark the beginning of a warm-up. We
will be cloudy Friday with a high of 64. Friday night Santa may have to fly
through a few raindrops. We will have light rain showers overnight Friday into
Saturday morning. Temps Christmas morning will be around 50! We will warm to a
cloudy high of 64 on Christmas afternoon.

The warm weather will last into next week with highs remaining in the mid-60s
through at least Tuesday.
