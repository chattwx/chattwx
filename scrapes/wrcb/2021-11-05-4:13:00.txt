Good news and bad news for your Friday morning. Good news - Temperatures aren't
quite as cold as forecasted this morning, so widespread frost won't be a
problem. However, it is cold in locations to the northwest in Bledsoe,
Sequatchie, Grundy, and Van Buren Counties where the Freeze Warning is still
active. Bad news - dense fog has developed in spots, so please watch for
periodic low visibility.

Now for the rest of your day, Friday will be mostly cloudy, but clouds won't be
as dense as the past two days, allowing for some sun. Highs will be in the
mid-50s. It'll remain partly cloudy tonight with lows in the low to mid-30s.

Saturday will be mostly sunny with some morning clouds clearing for a sunny
afternoon and highs around 60. Sunday will be sunny with highs near 65. Sunshine
will continue on Monday, reaching 68. Then, Tuesday will top out around 70 with
some clouds. Wednesday will be partly sunny with highs in the upper 60s to 70.
