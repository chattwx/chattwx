Happy Wednesday, everyone! After a chilly start, things are warming up nicely
around the region. We're expecting a few clouds to stream into the area this
afternoon, so look for partly sunny skies and highs climbing into the mid 60s.

This evening, partly cloudy skies will help to slow the temperature drop. We
will see temperatures slowly falling thru the 50s into the 40s. Overnight lows
will likely bottom out in the mid 40s by early Thursday morning.

Thursday will feature mostly cloudy skies. A south breeze will still help to
warm temps into the mid to upper 60s. Friday will feature more of the same. A
mostly cloudy sky, but with a warm south breeze we will likely see our day time
highs break the 70Â° mark in many spots. The record high for Friday is 75, set
back in 1924 so we will see how close we come to that number.

Changes arrive just in time for the weekend. Look for front #1 to arrive
bringing scattered showers throughout the day on Saturday. Severe weather is not
expected with this system. Things dry out briefly on Sunday, before our next wet
weather maker arrives Monday night into Tuesday bringing more widespread soaking
rain to the area, and much cooler temperatures.

Have a great rest of your Wednesday!
