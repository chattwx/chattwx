A few pop-up downpours will be around until about 9 PM this evening. Otherwise,
things will remain quiet as we wrap up this weekend.

Monday will start mild with temperatures in the low-70s under partly cloudy
skies. Highs will range from 87-92 degrees which is pretty typical for this time
of the year. Skies will be partly cloudy throughout the day with pop-up showers
and thunderstorms developing during the afternoon and evening hours. Be sure to
check on the radar if you have any outdoor plans tomorrow!

The rest of the week will feature a very similar pattern. Highs will generally
top out in the lower-90s each afternoon with overnight lows in the 70s. Pop-up
showers and storms will be around each afternoon with rain chances increasing
towards the end of the week.
