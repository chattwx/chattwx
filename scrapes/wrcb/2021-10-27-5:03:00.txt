Good morning, grab your jacket before you head out the door this Wednesday.
Temperatures to start the day are in the 30s to 40s. They'll warm up to near 58
by noon, and then afternoon highs will be in the mid-60s. It'll be a mostly to
partly sunny day with scattered clouds streaming by overhead. Tonight's lows
will be in the upper 40s to low 50s with increasing clouds.

Thursday will be an active weather day as a strong system moves into the
southeast. Locally, we'll deal with rain, gusty wind, and an isolated
thunderstorm throughout the day. The most widespread period of rain will be from
about 10am to 3pm ET. Wind Advisories have been issued for our Georgia counties
through 6pm Thursday for gusts up to 35 mph. We'll keep you updated on
additional advisories. Area-wide, wind gusts at 20-25mph are to be expected with
stronger gusts in the higher elevations. Highs will top out in the upper 50s to
60.

Showery conditions will continue on Friday and Saturday -- cool, dreary days
with highs only in the mid to upper 50s. Finally, sunshine returns just in time
for Halloween on Sunday with highs in the mid-60s.
