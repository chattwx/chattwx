Good Wednesday. We have had some nice showers and thunderstorms producing heavy
rain this afternoon. We may see a few more popping up through the evening hours.
However, they will be isolated. Heavy rain will be the biggest concern with any
cells that do develop.

Thursday we may get a stray shower or storm, but it will overall be a fairly
nice day with a sun/ cloud mix, highs in the mid 80s, and the humidity staying
low enough do it won't be miserable out.

Friday will be much the same with temps ranging from 68 in the morning to 88 in
the afternoon.

Saturday we will also hit 88, but I think we will have a few more widespread
showers and storms to deal with, especially in the afternoon.

Sunday marks a dramatic return to the heat and humidity. We will get back into
the low 90s with dew points approaching 70 which means a lot of moisture in the
air.

We will stay in the low 90s all next week with minimal rain chances each day.
