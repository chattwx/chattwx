Another storm system will move by the Tennessee Valley on Wednesday. We will be
in the warm sector of this storm and it will be weaker than the one we saw a few
days ago. Clouds will increase tonight and showers will move in in the morning.
It will be cold with highs in the mid 40's so it will be a cold rain on
Wednesday. Amounts will be near a half inch. Skies will be mostly cloudy
Wednesday night with lows near freezing. Thursday will be partly cloudy and cold
with highs in the low 40's. Friday should be warmer with highs near 50 and
partly cloudy skies. 

This weekend will be seasonable with highs in the low 50's.Saturday will be dry
and Sunday may have a few scattered light showers. Next week looks to be dry,
too. Highs should be in the mid 50's Monday and Tuesday. Paul Barys
