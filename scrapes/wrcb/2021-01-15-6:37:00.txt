Good Friday! We saw a few drizzles this morning, and even some light snow in
Bledsoe County. We may get a few more light sprinkles this afternoon. Highs will
be in the upper 40s, 50 in Chattanooga.

Colder and cloudy weather moves in tonight. Saturday morning we will be in the
upper 20s and low 30s. We will also have some valley flurries and light snow
showers in the morning. There is a WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY for Grundy, Warren,
and Van Buren counties tonight through 11 pm Saturday. Those areas could get up
to 2" of snow. Other spots on the Plateau and in the Blue Ridge will get 1/4" to
1/2". In the valley, we will have only some flurries and maybe a light dusting.
Saturday afternoon will be cold and cloudy with highs struggling to get past 40
degrees.

Sunday will be cold and cloudy with temps ranging from 31 to 48. Monday will
start cold with some high elevation light snow showers in the morning.
