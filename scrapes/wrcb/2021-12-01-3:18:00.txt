Good morning and happy 1st day of December. We are now in the meteorological
winter season, but it sure won't feel like it outside. Yes, cold in the morning
in the 30s to begin your Wednesday, followed by comfortable afternoon highs in
the mid-60s with a partly sunny sky. Clouds will likely peak in the afternoon.
Then, tonight will be partly cloudy with lows in the low 40s. 

Thursday and Friday will both be mostly sunny and warm with highs near 70.
Saturday will have more clouds for a partly sunny sky and staying dry with highs
near 68. The partly sunny weather will continue on Sunday with highs around 65.
The great majority of the day will be dry with a slim chance for a spotty
shower. Scattered showers should move in for Monday morning with highs in the
mid-50s. It'll stay in the 50s for Tuesday, too.
