If you love warm weather, today is your last day to enjoy with highs from 80-84
for most locations. But first, once again, there are areas of dense fog in river
valleys. There won't be quite as much in the TN River valley extending from
Chattanooga to Dayton today as the past 2 days, but continue to use caution for
slightly reduced visibility. Fog will be dense in the Sequatchie Valley, present
through about 10am ET/9am CT. Friday will be a partly cloudy day with nice
weather through mid-afternoon. Then, scattered showers/storms will sweep through
our northwestern counties from about 5-10pm ET. Next, the cold front will pass
tonight along with a line of showers from about 1am to 8am from west to east
early on Saturday morning.

Then, it's nice, fall weather for the rest of your weekend. The official high on
Saturday will be at midnight with afternoon highs only in the mid-60s. Saturday
will have clearing skies, dropping humidity, and a NNW breeze at 10-15mph, gusts
at 20-25. Sunday will begin in the low to mid-40s with highs in the mid-60s and
sunny. Monday will have another chilly morning followed by upper 60s to 70 in
the afternoon. Tuesday mostly sunny and reaching the low 70s.
