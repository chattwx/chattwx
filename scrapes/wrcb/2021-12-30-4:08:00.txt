After last night's storms, we get a break for today's weather. A few lingering
showers will be possible for our far southern communities in Georgia and
Alabama. For everywhere else, watch out for patchy fog/mist this morning. It'll
be cloudy during the morning, and then clouds will partially clear for late
afternoon and the evening. Highs today will be in the upper 60s to low 70s.
Clouds will increase again overnight with lows from 50-55.

Friday will be mostly cloudy with a chance for scattered showers and possibly a
thunderstorm in the afternoon and evening. Highs in the upper 60s. Overall, it
doesn't look very active in the daytime or evening, which of course is New
Year's Eve. What we'll have to keep an eye on is storm potential for closer to
midnight, 1am, 2am, etc. With that being said, Saturday will be another Storm
Alert Weather Day for possible severe weather in the early morning hours and
again Saturday night into Sunday morning. There will certainly be dry portions
of the daytime on Saturday with warm highs near 74.

As rain wraps up Sunday morning, a second system will develop to the southwest
bringing more rain showers later in the day and then possible wintry mix Sunday
night as cold air filters in. It's still too early to go into details, but we
should have a better idea over the next 24-48 hours. By Monday morning, it's
back to below freezing temperatures.
