I hope everyone has had a fantastic weekend! The rest of your sunny will feature
partly cloudy skies with temperatures falling into the lower-80s by 7 PM.
Conditions will remain calm overnight as lows drop back into the low to mid-60s.

The heat and humidity will increase Monday into Tuesday as southerly flow brings
in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Highs will range from 85-89 degrees each
afternoon. Rain chances will be low, but a stray shower will be possible late
Tuesday.

In the tropics, Tropical Storm Nicholas formed earlier this morning in the
Western Gulf of Mexico. Nicholas will likely make landfall Tuesday along the
Texas coastline. Portions of the Texas coast could receive up to 12" of rainfall
early next week. As the storm slowly moves northward, flow from the Gulf of
Mexico will increase our rain chances Wednesday through the upcoming weekend.
The heaviest rain will likely stay well to our southwest, but we will keep a
close eye on the progression of Tropical Storm Nicholas in the coming days.
