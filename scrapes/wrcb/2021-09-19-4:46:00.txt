A Storm Alert Weather Day is in effect for Sunday as we track another round of
heavy rain across the Tennessee Valley. Flash Flood Watches were extended
further east to include Chattanooga, Cleveland, Dalton, Ellijay, and much of our
coverage area. An additional 1-3" of rainfall with localized amounts of 4-6" are
anticipated through Monday evening. Areas of flash flooding will be possible,
especially in low-lying areas. The heaviest rain will set up during the
afternoon hours Sunday and Monday.

Scattered showers and storms will continue into Tuesday, but the coverage will
be more hit and miss. High temperatures will remain around 80 degrees.

A cold front will push through the area early Wednesday, bringing showers for
the first part of the day. We will finally begin to clear out Wednesday
afternoon as much drier air filters into the area. The first day of fall is on
Wednesday, and it certainly will feel that way as highs top out in the mid-70s
with overnight lows ranging from 48-55 degrees across the Tennessee Valley.
Fall-like weather with plenty of sunshine will continue through the weekend!
