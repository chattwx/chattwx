Good Friday! It is cooler and cloudy this morning with a few light sprinkles in
the Blue Ridge, and even a few areas of light sleet on the Cumberland Plateau.
Everything will clear out by 9am. We also have some areas of fog you may need to
navigate this morning. This afternoon will remain overcast and cool with highs
in the mid to upper 40s.

Look for rain showers overnight into Saturday morning with temps dropping into
the low 40s. It will be rainy all day Saturday (1/2"-1") with temps in the 40s
all day.

It now looks like we can reduce the rain chance for Valentine's Day to only a
few sporadic showers during the day with overcast skies and temps ranging from
40 in the morning to 46 in the afternoon.

Monday late afternoon we will have more rain moving through with possibly even a
wintry mix during the evening on the Cumberland Plateau.
