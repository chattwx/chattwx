Skies will clear off tonight and temperatures will drop into the 30's all over
the Tennessee valley. Some temperatures on the plateau could drop into the upper
20's as the winds die down. So be prepared for some freezing temperatures in the
usual cold spots. Only some light scattered frost will occur in the cities.

 

Highs on Thursday will warm into the low 60's with a west wind at 10 to 15 with
partly cloudy skies. Lows Thursday night will be in the low 40's in the city
with some mid to upper 30's elsewhere. Friday will see more clouds with warmer
highs in the upper 60's.

Saturday will be wet with showers and a few isolated storms. Rain could turn
heavy at times. Highs should be in the mid and upper 60's. Sunday will see some
clearing with a mild high in the low 70's. Monday and Tuesday will be mostly to
partly sunny with highs warming to near 80 or so. Rain could redevelop Wednesday
night. Paul Barys
