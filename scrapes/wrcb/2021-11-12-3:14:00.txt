Good morning, clouds have cleared out overnight, but fog has also developed. The
most likely locations for the lowest visible this morning are valley spots from
Chattanooga and westward. Fog will last until about 9am with improvements for
the rest of the morning. We'll have plentiful sunshine today, hitting the upper
50s to 60 by noon and afternoon highs from 61-65 for most locations. Clouds will
increase this evening and tonight, especially in Tennessee, as a reinforcing
cold front passes across the area. This passage will mainly be a dry cold front,
but an isolated light shower will be possible from about 11pm to 4am.

Saturday morning will start with temperatures from 35-40 with highs in the upper
40s to low 50s under a sunny sky. Temperatures will really bottom out for Sunday
morning with widespread freezing possible in the upper 20s to low 30s. Sunday
will have a mix of sun and clouds and highs in the mid-50s. Monday again will
range from AM 30s to PM low 50s. The cold will persist for Tuesday morning with
highs warmer near 60 and sunny.
