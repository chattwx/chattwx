Skies will range from partly to mostly cloudy overnight as lows remain mild in
the upper-50s.

Monday will be a Storm Alert Weather Day as we track a broken line of storms
along an approaching cold front. The highest severe threat will stay just to our
east, but a few storms could contain damaging wind gusts and small hail. The
best time frame for any strong to severe storms will be from 9 AM to 2 PM. After
the front passes to our east, temperatures will drop quickly into the 60s.
Conditions will improve by the early evening hours.

Tuesday and Wednesday look to stay dry under partly cloudy skies. Temperatures
will be seasonable with highs ranging from 64-68 degrees and overnight lows in
the upper-40s.

Our next rain maker arrives Thursday as a low-pressure system moves in our
direction. Scattered showers will be around Thursday morning through Saturday
morning before moving out of the area. Temperatures will be cooler than average
with highs ranging from 58-63 degrees.
