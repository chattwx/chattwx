Happy Friday! We are going to begin our day with areas of patchy dense fog
before 10 AM. Visibility could drop below 1 mile for your morning commute, so be
sure to give yourself extra time. Skies will range from partly to mostly cloudy
for much of the day with highs ranging from 63-67 degrees. Gradual clearing will
occur late this evening into the overnight hours as lows fall back into the 40s.

Plenty of sunshine will be around for your Saturday with highs remaining very
seasonable, topping out in the lower 70s.

Temperatures will warm into the upper 70s on Sunday as a warm front lifts to our
north. Cloud cover and humidity will increase during the afternoon and evening
hours, but any rain chances will stay well to our north.

Multiple cold fronts will pass through next week, keeping things unsettled. At
this point, the best chance for rain and thunderstorms looks to be Monday and
Wednesday. We will continue to fine-tune next week's forecast in the coming
days.
