Happy Sunday! Areas of patchy fog will be around before 8 AM. The rest of your
Sunday will feature partly to mostly cloudy skies with highs ranging from 68-72
degrees. Overnight lows will remain mild, only dropping into the mid-50s.

The final week of 2021 will wrap up with above-average temperatures along with
an active pattern. Monday into Tuesday will feature highs near 70 degrees each
afternoon and a few showers, especially Tuesday evening.

Rain chances will increase Wednesday and Thursday as an area of low pressure
develops to our west. Periods of heavy rain will be possible with rainfall
amounts of 1-2". A few thunderstorms will be possible, but the severe threat
will remain low through the middle of the week.

We will be watching another system this weekend that could bring another round
of heavy rain to the area. Much colder air could arrive behind this system as we
usher in 2022.
