Good morning! Your Monday will begin with sticky, humid conditions outside. A
few isolated downpours, moving slowly south, will last until about 6am.
Additionally, areas of patchy fog will be possible through 8am, primarily in
river valleys. After this morning activity, the big weather news for today
continues to be the heat. Highs will range from 90-94 for most locations with a
mostly sunny sky. Humidity will start to drop late afternoon into evening with a
first cold front, so the heat index will probably max out at about 96-97. Then,
a second cold front will pass tonight. This one will usher in a less humid air
mass. Lows around the mid-60s.

Tuesday will feel great after this past week -- lower humidity, highs in the
mid-80s, and a mostly sunny sky. Wednesday morning will have lows in the upper
50s to low 60s followed by highs near 85 and lots of sun. Thursday will be
mostly sunny and 87. Friday will be hot again around 90. Then, isolated PM
storms will develop on Saturday with highs near 90. Sunday and Monday are more
questionable as we'll be watching a potential tropical system in the Gulf of
Mexico that may bring us rain locally by then.
