Friday will be mostly sunny and muggy in the morning, becoming partly sunny for
the afternoon with some scattered showers/storms (30%). It'll be hot with highs
in the upper 80s to low 90s - about 92 in Chattanooga. Heat index values will be
in the upper 90s. A few storms will continue into the evening and night hours,
so keep that in mind for Nightfall, the high school football Jamboree at Finley
Stadium, or whatever your Friday night plans are. You can download the WRCB
weather app to keep track of radar. Overnight lows will be in the upper 60s to
low 70s under a partly cloudy sky.

Saturday will remain hot in the low 90s, and shower and storm chances will
increase, especially during the afternoon hours. Periods of showers and storms
will be likely on Sunday with temperatures dropping into the upper 80s. Then,
daily rain chances will continue through next work-week, and it'll be cooler in
the mid-80s. 

Tropical Depression Fred (currently located north of Cuba) may bring added
rainfall on Tuesday, especially to our eastern communities.
