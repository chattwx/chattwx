Good Friday! Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day as it will be a very wet commute
this morning with the rain heavy at times. Localized street flooding and
hydroplaning will be threats so please go slow this morning. The rain showers
will continue this afternoon and evening with a few passing showers even
lingering into the overnight. Rainfall amounts today will range from 1" to 2".

Saturday will not be a washout, but it will be warm and cloudy with the high
reaching 71 and a few passing light showers here and there. The rain chance will
bee 30%. Sunday will be much the same though even warmer with the high reaching
76. We might get a sprinkle or two through the day.

Sunday night into Monday morning another round of heavy rain will move through
making it another wet commute Monday morning. We will get another 1" to 2" of
rain during that time. The rain will taper off Monday afternoon and we will be
cooler with the high getting to about 60.

Flooding could definitely be an issue Sunday night into Monday.
