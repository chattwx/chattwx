A lot of folks saw 1" to 2.5" of rain this afternoon. Several reports of
flooding and wind damage were reported. Several reports of hail came in today as
well. We will see more spotty storms popping up each afternoon for the rest of
the week.

Each day will sport mornings in the low 70s and highs in the low 90s. The heat
index will be in the upper 90s, and may briefly hit 100. Each day will also see
scattered thunderstorms mainly in the afternoon producing heavy rain, lightning,
and gusty winds. One or two storms could also produce small hail.

Next week we should see the temperature recede a bit with highs in the mid to
upper 80s. The humidity will also be just a little lower so we may get a little
relief.

Potential Tropical Cyclone #6 is in the Atlantic and will likely be in the Gulf
of Mexico as a tropical storm by the end of the week.
