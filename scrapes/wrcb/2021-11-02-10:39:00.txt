Happy Tuesday, everyone!

Our Tuesday afternoon will feature a mix of clouds and some sunshine with highs
slightly cooler, only in the upper 50s to lower 60s. A dry front moves through
late tonight, ushering in a reinforcing shot of cooler temperatures. Highs on
Wednesday will be about 10 degrees cooler, only averaging in the lower 50s.

The front stalls, as a wave of energy moves along it, bringing increasing clouds
Wednesday, with shower chances returning Wednesday night. Scattered showers will
be possible Thursday, along with plenty of cloud cover. Highs on Thursday will
likely not get out of the 40s in most locations. Brrr!

The upcoming weekend looks nice and quiet, but it will be chilly. Highs in the
50s to near 60, and lows down into the 30s, so planters beware! Now if cloud
cover hangs tough late week into the weekend, look for these overnight lows to
be warmer, but at this point I think the dry air wins out, and leads to a cooler
period. Of course we will be fine tuning these number throughout the rest of the
week so stay tuned! High temps will rebound back into the 60s with sunshine next
week, but that's still a few degrees below normal for this time of the year.

Have a great rest of your Tuesday!

Bledsoe County has a Frost Advisory from midnight tonight to 10am on Wednesday
morning.
