Good Friday! The colder weather is almost here! We do have some other weather to
get through first. The front will create some scattered showers and maybe even a
thunderstorm or two mainly I-75 and west through this evening and into tonight.
The Storm Prediction Center has Chattanooga and west under a low, "marginal"
risk of severe weather. Friday Night football games should be aware of the
possibility of lightning. We will see a line of scattered storms moving through
during the overnight as well. The biggest threats from any storms will be heavy
rain and lightning with one or two of those storms producing damaging winds. As
a result we are calling it a Storm Alert Weather Day.

After 4am we will continue to see light showers on and off until 8am. Then skies
will rapidly clear out, temps will fall, and we will see winds picking up a bit
from the north. Highs Saturday will only reach the low to mid-60s.

Sunday will be cool, sunny, and dry. Temps will range from 47 in the morning to
68 in the afternoon. We will warm a little through next week, but it should stay
dry and fall like until another front brings in more rain Thursday and another
shot of cooler air for NEXT weekend.
