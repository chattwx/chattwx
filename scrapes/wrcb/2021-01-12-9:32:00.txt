Pesky clouds will erode by afternoon. We're starting to see them breaking in
Tennessee as of 10:30AM.

As clouds continue to break today, it will flirt with the normal high of 50.
This morning, it only dropped to 40 in Chattanooga. It will be a much colder
night today, with lows 10-15 colder near 26-27.

Tonight and Wednesday night will be cold in the 20s, however sunshine in the
afternoons, will make for pleasant January days, as highs creep up slightly
above normal to the mid 50s. Hey, we'll take it.

A few rain showers, and perhaps a few flurries will be possible overnight
Thursday night, through Friday morning. This next system has limited moisture,
and therefore I'm not expecting an event. An upper level low will track north of
the Tennessee Valley on Saturday. A small drizzle, flurry chance is possible for
our Tennessee counties during the day Saturday.

TODAY:

12PM: Clouds Breaking, 43

3PM: More sunshine, 49

6PM: M. Clear, 44
