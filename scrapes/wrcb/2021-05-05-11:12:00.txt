It's still mostly cloudy this morning, but by day's end, we'll have a mostly
clear sky and low humidity to enjoy. As the cold front pushes across our area
this morning, there will be a few spots of light showers and sprinkles, mainly
along area ridgelines, through about 1pm. Clouds will gradually break and clear
through Wednesday afternoon with highs near 73.

Thursday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 70s. A wave will bring a
chance for light showers from about 9pm Thursday night to 4am Friday morning.
It'll be gone before daybreak. Friday again will be mostly sunny, but cooler
with highs around 68.

For your weekend, Sunday - Mother's Day - is now shaping up to be the better day
of the weekend. Saturday will have a partly sunny sky with scattered showers in
the afternoon and evening, especially in our Tennessee communities. Highs will
be mild at 68. Sunday will be warmer with highs in the upper 70s, a partly sunny
sky, and showers look to hold off until the evening/night. If you have outdoor
plans for Mom, check back for weekend updates.
