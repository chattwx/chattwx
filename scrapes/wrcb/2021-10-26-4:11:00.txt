Good morning, we're kicking off your Tuesday with low level clouds blanketing
our area. Clouds will persist through midmorning and then gradually clear,
becoming mostly sunny for the afternoon. Highs today will be below normal in the
low to mid-60s with a north breeze at 8-12 mph. 

Clouds will increase slightly tonight with lows from 40-45 in the metro area.
Locations outside of cities, especially to the east -- Cherokee, Polk, McMinn
Counties -- prepare for lows to be in the mid to upper 30s. Patchy frost will be
possible in Cherokee County.

Wednesday will be partly cloudy with highs near 68. Then, Thursday will have
widespread rain with highs around 60. The system will linger over our area
producing additional times of showers on Friday with cool temperatures. Highs
will only be in the mid-50s. Saturday will have scattered showers especially
early in the day with a mostly cloudy sky and highs in the upper 50s. Finally,
by Halloween on Sunday, we'll be dry and sunny with highs in the mid-60s.
