LOW TREE POLLEN:

For the first time, in a long time, the Tree Pollen counts have dropped to the
low category (6). Grass is in the moderate range (14) - which will be the case
most of summer, until ragweed becomes the biggest allergen in the fall.

METEOROLOGICAL SUMMER:

Then, it's the first day of Meteorological Summer. What's that mean?

It means for record keeping and data keeping purposes -
temperature/humidity/rain/wind, it's easier for mets to start it on the 1st of
the month, rather than when the astronomical summer (summer solstice) begins.
It's cleaner this way for averages and statistics. This is why meteorological
fall starts September 1, and meteorological winter is December 1.

ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON:
Begins today, too. You've seen the names and expected hurricanes and tropical
storms this year. The season will end November 30th. Tropical development is not
expected in the next 48 hours.

SPRINKLE TODAY, SHOWER TOMORROW, WIDESPREAD RAIN THURSDAY:

Besides a sprinkle today, west of I-75, most of the day will be dry with low
humidity. Tomorrow actually looks like dew points stay in the 50s in the
morning, making it a comfortable start to Wednesday. Isolated showers are
expected tomorrow, with widespread rain Thursday.

TODAY:

12PM: Increasing Clouds, 77

3PM: Sprinkle west? 82

6PM: Sprinkle west? 81
