Good Monday. It always seems to be the 3rd week of October when we get that
season-changing, permanently cooling cold front that REALLY ushers in the fall
season. It looks like this weekend that front will arrive right on schedule.

Tonight will be warm with pretty clear skies and temps dropping through the 70s
this evening.

Overnight we will see a first approaching front bring in thick cloud cover and
some light spotty showers for the Tuesday morning commute. Wet roads will be the
only threat to getting to school and work. It will remain cloudy with a few
on/off showers in the afternoon and highs in the upper 70s.

Wednesday and Thursday will be dry with mostly cloudy skies and highs in the low
80s.

Friday the season-changing front will approach and give us clouds and a few
showers through the day Friday into Friday night. The high Friday will reach 84.
Some of those showers will linger into Saturday morning with morning temps in
the low to mid-60s.

Saturday afternoon skies will clear out, and we will be MUCH cooler with the
highs only reaching about 70!

Grab a jacket for a chilly Sunday morning with temps in the upper 40s, 50 in
Chattanooga. Sunday afternoon will be sunny with very fall-like high of 68.
