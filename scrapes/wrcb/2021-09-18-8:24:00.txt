Indoor activities will be the way to go this weekend as periods of heavy rain
impact the Tennessee Valley. A Flash Flood Watch is currently in effect for
Dekalb and Jackson Counties in Alabama, where 3-5" of rainfall could fall
through Sunday night. The rest of the area could receive 1-3" of rain with
isolated higher amounts. Flash flooding in low-lying areas will be the primary
concern this weekend. Increased rain chances will keep temperatures in the 76-81
range Saturday and Sunday.

Periods of rain and thunderstorms will continue Monday and Tuesday with high
temperatures remaining around 80 degrees.

A cold front will arrive just in time for the first day of fall Wednesday. Rain
chances will dwindle by the afternoon, and drier air will begin to filter into
the area Wednesday evening. Humidity will take a nosedive overnight as
temperatures turn much cooler. This cold front will set up a spectacular end of
the week with highs in the mid-70s and overnight lows in the lower-50s!
