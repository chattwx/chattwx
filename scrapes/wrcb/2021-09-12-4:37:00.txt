Happy Sunday! We will be waking up to another pleasant morning with temperatures
ranging from 55-63 degrees across the area. A broad area of high pressure to our
east will keep cloud cover at bay and rain chances at zero for your Sunday.
Temperatures will be 3-5 degrees warmer than the last several days as highs
climb into the upper-80s later this afternoon. Skies will remain clear tonight
with lows dropping back into the 60s.

The heat and humidity will ramp back up Monday and Tuesday as highs reach near
90 degrees. Skies will remain mostly sunny with only a small chance of a shower
during the afternoon hours. Lows will range from 64-68 degrees each night.

A developing tropical system in the Western Gulf of Mexico could bring the
Tennessee Valley an increased chance of showers and storms by the middle of next
week. For now, we will keep rain chances in the 30-40% range Wednesday through
Friday, but be on the lookout for adjustments to the forecast.
