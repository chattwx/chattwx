Today will be sunny to mostly sunny with highs around 70 with a light northerly
breeze. It'll be in the 60s for your evening plans, and then overnight, lows
will drop to the low to mid-40s under a mostly clear sky. Friday will be a
similar day with lots of sunshine and a few clouds. Highs will be a bit warmer
near 74.

Saturday will be mostly sunny. Wind will be out of the south with warmer
afternoon temperatures near 78 - a beautiful day to enjoy outside. Clouds will
increase for the evening and overnight with an isolated shower chance for our
northern Tennessee communities. Then, Sunday will have a partly sunny sky, but
it'll be warmer. Highs will be back to normal around 80, and the shower chance
will continue for our far northern areas. It's not enough to ruin your day, but
something to keep an eye on if you plan to be outside.

Monday will be mostly cloudy with highs around 80 with a few isolated showers.
For Tuesday and Wednesday, shower chances increase slightly to scattered, and
it'll remain warm in the low 80s.
