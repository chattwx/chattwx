Good morning, we begin Friday with cool temperatures in the 40s for many
locations and patchy river valley fog. Much of the morning will be spent in the
50s, hitting the low to mid-60s by lunch, and then afternoon highs from 70-75.
Another beautiful fall day with low humidity and sunny skies. Friday night
football games will mostly be spent in the 60s. Overnight, a layer of high, thin
clouds will arrive from the west with lows in the upper 40s to low 50s.

Those thin clouds will remain Saturday morning with the sun shining through
them, and then clear out for the afternoon. Highs will be warmer in the mid to
upper 70s. Sunday will begin the day near 55 and reach highs in the upper 70s to
80 with a sunny sky. The humidity will still be comfortable for all the IRONMAN
athletes, volunteers, and fans.

The sunny, dry weather will continue into next work week, but it'll be more
humid and warmer with above normal temperatures. Low 80s on Monday, near 84 on
Tuesday, 86 on Wednesday, and 84 on Thursday.
