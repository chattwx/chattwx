TONIGHT:

Isolated strong storms are expected this evening. Wind gusts up to 40 mph is
possible, however, rainfall amounts look fairly meek, bringing only 0.10" to
0.50" for most.

SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM:

The other weather story of course, is the shocking temperatures arriving
tonight. The cold front moves in by 9PM-10PM. Winds will gust with this frontal
passage during the Lookouts game, then boom, temperatures in the mid 50s
tomorrow morning.

It will be a great weekend to open the windows, give the AC a break, and enjoy
the lower humidity.

Highs tomorrow - 70, broken clouds - ~15 below normal for late May.

Highs Sunday - 73, mostly sunny

Highs Monday - 80, partly cloudy
