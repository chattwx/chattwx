Today will be a gorgeous Easter Sunday. Cold in the morning for sunrise or early
church services in the 30s, so grab a coat. By noon for Easter brunch, we'll be
in the upper 50s to 60. Then, afternoon egg hunts will be comfortable in the
upper 60s to low 70s. All day, we'll have a sunny sky with a light SW to W
breeze.

Tonight will be mostly clear with lows from 40-45. The nice weather will
continue on Monday with sunshine and a few clouds and highs in the mid-70s. Both
Tuesday and Wednesday will be partly cloudy and near 75. Wednesday will have a
chance for a couple of isolated showers. Then, we'll have rain and storm chances
for Thursday and Friday. Current timing indicates two waves both happening
during the morning hours, so the week may end with messy morning commutes on
Thursday and Friday. Highs again will be near 75.

Saturday will be partly sunny with a few scattered showers possible especially
for our south and eastern counties. Then, Sunday looks to be nice with a mostly
sunny sky and around 70.
