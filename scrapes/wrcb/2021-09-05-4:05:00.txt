Happy Sunday! It will be another comfortable start to the day as many
communities across the Tennessee Valley wake up to the lower-60s. Temperatures
will gradually warm into the mid-80s by the late afternoon hours. Cloud coverage
will increase throughout the day as a cold front approaches from the west. It
looks like most of the rain will hold off until after 8 PM, but a few showers
will be possible during the daylight hours. Rain coverage will increase
throughout the night and linger into Monday morning. Rainfall amounts will
generally remain under 1 inch.

Monday through Wednesday will feature high temperatures ranging from 84-88
degrees with tolerable humidity levels. A few showers will be around during the
afternoon hours with the best rain chance coming Wednesday. A reinforcing cold
front will bring a refreshing blast of fall-like air to wrap up the week.
