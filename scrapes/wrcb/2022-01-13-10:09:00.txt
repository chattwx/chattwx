Happy Thursday, everyone! We're tracking an increase in clouds across the
Tennessee Valley this afternoon. A weak moving front will arrive this afternoon
& evening bringing a period of cloud cover and a few spotty showers. Overall,
any rainfall amounts should remain very light & brief. Highs will warm into the
low to mid 50s.

Tonight, look for clearing skies and another cold night. Overnight lows will
fall back into the upper 20s and lower 30s.

Friday will feature pretty quiet weather with a mix of clouds and sunshine and
highs, slightly cooler, in the 40s.

This weekend still looks very interesting around the area. A potent system will
drop south Saturday, bringing increasing clouds and a few late day rain showers.
Sunday will feature off & on periods of rain, with colder air arriving during
the day. This will likely lead to a changeover to snow across the region. Still
some uncertainty in exact storm track, and when the cold air arrives, but look
for the potential of some accumulations across parts of the region. We hope to
get much more specific in future forecasts about possible amounts and impacts.
Either way, plan on a wintry feeling weekend ahead.

Next week looks fairly quiet with a mix of clouds and sunshine and temperatures
chilly to kickoff the week, but warming back near normal by mid-week.

Have a great Thursday!
