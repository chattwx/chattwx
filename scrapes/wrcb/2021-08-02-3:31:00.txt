Good Monday. Skies will remain somewhat overcast heading into the evening. We
may see one or two pop-up showers, but it will be no big deal. Humidity levels
are relatively low so it should be a fairly pleasant evening for the start of
August with temps falling through the low 80s.

Tuesday will be partly cloudy with the high reaching a very doable 86 degrees.
We may see an afternoon shower or two east of Chattanooga close to the Blue
Ridge Mtns.

Wednesday through Friday will sport highs in the mid-80s with manageable
humidity and a few afternoon showers here and there.

The weekend will see afternoon highs climbing back into the low 90s (where they
belong) with higher humidity. We should have a nice mix of sun and clouds this
weekend with only a slight chance for an afternoon shower or storm both days.
