It has been another nice day across the Tennessee Valley! Temperatures warmed
into the upper-70s this afternoon under mostly sunny skies. Temperatures will
fall back into the mid to upper-50s tonight with only a few passing clouds from
time to time. Patchy river fog will develop after midnight and hang around
through your Monday morning commute. Give yourself a little extra time to get to
your destination tomorrow morning.

Above-average temperatures and increasing humidity will return to the area
Monday through Friday. Highs will range from 80-86 degrees each afternoon with
overnight lows falling to around 60 degrees during the night. Skies will
generally remain sunny each afternoon with cloud cover increasing towards the
end of the week. No rain is in the forecast for the next 6-7 days.

In the tropics, Hurricane Sam continues to strengthen and now has 145 mph
sustained winds. It is unlikely that Sam will have any direct impacts on the
United States.
