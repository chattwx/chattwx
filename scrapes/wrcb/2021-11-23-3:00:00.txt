Good Tuesday. We are in for another chilly evening with clear skies and temps
dropping through the 30s. We will fall all the way into the upper 20s by
Wednesday morning. Outside areas will drop into the low to mid 20s. We will warm
nicely in the afternoon to a pleasant 56.

Thanksgiving Day will start with a cool low of 35. We will warm to 59 for the
high. Clouds will increase through the day, and we will see some light scattered
rain showers after 4pm lingering into late Thursday night. Rainfall amounts will
be light, ranging from 1/10" to 1/4".

Black Friday we will see cooler, blustery weather returning. We start at 35, but
only make it to 48 for the high. Temps will continue spilling into the mid to
upper 20s Saturday morning. Saturday afternoon will be mostly sunny with highs
in the mid 50s.

Sunday we will have a few more clouds, but it will still be a nice fall day with
temps ranging from 35 to 55.
