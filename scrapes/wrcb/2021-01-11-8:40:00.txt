While there is not a Winter Weather Advisory for the Cumberland Plateau, a light
wintry mix will continue for Grundy, Bledsoe, Marion, Franklin, and Sequatchie
counties today. Due to the very light nature of the system, most snow will melt
on the road ways. A dusting of 1" to 2" is possible for these location, but
mostly on the grass, and elevated surfaces like roofs, tree branches, decks, and
vehicles.

Look for this on and off until 8PM-10PM before things wind down.

It will be cold tonight in the mid 30s in the valley.

Tuesday will bring broken cloud cover with temperatures returning to the 50s.
Wednesday and Thursday will be the pick days this week, as highs will be
slightly above normal near 52-55 with sunshine. Plan your walks accordingly!

TODAY:

12PM: Mix Plateau, light rain in the valley, 40

3PM: Mix Plateau, light rain in the valley, 41

Mix Plateau, light rain in the valley, 39
