Early Sunday evening will be very pleasant for January. Then late evening and
overnight, spotty showers and few higher elevation flurries will be possible.
Any accumulations will be minimal at a dusting, except for the highest mountains
of Cherokee and Monroe Counties where about 1" may happen. Sky cover will be
partly cloudy with lows around freezing.

The first 3 days of the work-week will generally be quiet and nice. Monday will
have a mix of sun and clouds with the greatest sunshine for areas south and
highs near 49. Tuesday will be partly sunny with highs in the low 50s, and
Wednesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 50s again. Both days will
have a small isolated shower chance. Then, greater coverage of scattered showers
will develop on Thursday with highs around 55. There is still low confidence on
what will happen on Friday as data are fluctuating. I'm leaving in some
scattered showers, but the heaviest rain does continue to look to stay south of
us. Highs in the low 50s. Saturday will be mostly sunny and near 50.
