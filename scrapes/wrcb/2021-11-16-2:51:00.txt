Good Tuesday. The clouds will clear this evening, and it should be nice with
temps in the 50s and lots of stars (and maybe a few Leonid Meteors) overhead.
Wednesday is definitely the pick day of the forecast. It will be a mild, spring
day with a low of 50 and a high of 73 under mostly sunny skies.

Thursday we start to come back to reality. A cold front will bring in light rain
showers followed by a burst of cold air. Friday will be cold and dry with temps
ranging from 35 to 54.

The weekend will be chilly as well. Saturday we start at 33 and make it to 59
with sunshine in the afternoon. Sunday will be mostly cloudy with an outside
chance for a sprinkle. The high will make it to 61.

Another front brings in more rain Monday followed by what may be the coldest air
of the season midweek.
