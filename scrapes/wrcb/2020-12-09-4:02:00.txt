Good Wednesday. We are off to a bitterly cold start with temps in the 20s this
morning. What a warm-up we will have this afternoon, though. Highs will climb
into the upper 50s, 60 in Chattanooga. Skies will be sunny all day.

Thursday and Friday will warm up even more. Mornings will be in the 30s with
highs in the low to mid-60s.

The weekend will sport some scattered showers Saturday and possibly Sunday,
though there is differing model data on whether or not the rain will carry over
into Sunday and possibly even Monday. Monday, if we do get rain showers, it may
mix with some light snow showers in the upper elevations. Stay tuned. We will be
refining that weekend forecast over the next few days.
