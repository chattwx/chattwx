Happy Thanksgiving! We'll have dry conditions this morning with a partly sunny
sky for any outdoor plans like turkey trot run/walks or frying a turkey. Clouds
will be on the increase for the afternoon along with scattered showers. Showers
will start up about 2pm/1pm CT for our NW counties and end for our SE counties
by 1am ET. It won't be raining that whole time. The showers will be inconsistent
and break up as they move east, but expect on and off periods of light rain.
Showers will begin in Chattanooga around 4-5pm. Valley locations at a Trace-0.1"
with some locations having the chance of staying dry. Higher elevations,
especially the plateau, at 0.1-0.25". Highs today will be mild around 60, and
then temperatures will drop tonight with lows in the upper 20s to low 30s.

Black Friday will be chilly spent in the 40s with a north breeze and mostly
sunny sky. Saturday morning will begin with most locations in the 20s and highs
in the mid-50s. Sunday will also top out in the mid-50s with a mix of sun and
clouds. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday all look dry with highs ranging from the
mid-50s to upper 50s. Each day getting a little warmer.
