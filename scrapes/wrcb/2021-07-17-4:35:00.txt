Our Saturday will start off dry with a mix of sun and clouds through
mid-morning. Another round of scattered showers and thunderstorms will fire up
this afternoon and continue through the evening hours. There will not be much of
a severe threat, but a few storms may contain gusty winds and heavy rainfall.
Most of the shower and storm activity will fade by 10 PM.

Sunday will be a similar story with scattered showers and storms likely during
the afternoon and evening hours. Highs will top out in the mid-80s with lows
dropping to around 70 degrees.

A few showers will be around to start the work week on Monday with highs
remaining in the mid-80s. Rain chances will be low Tuesday through Thursday as
drier air settles into the region. Temperatures will return to the 90s along
with plenty of humidity through the end of next week.
