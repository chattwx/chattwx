What a difference a day makes! Temperatures will be nearly 20 degrees colder for
your Sunday as cold air settles into the region behind a cold front. A few
showers will be around before 8 AM before skies become sunny later today. Any
additional rainfall this morning will be very light.

Skies will remain clear tonight with temperatures dropping below freezing across
much of the Tennessee Valley. It will finally feel like December!

We will take a break from the December warmth through the middle of the week as
temperatures remain seasonable. Highs will top out in the 50s each afternoon
with overnight lows dropping into the 30s.

Friday is Christmas Eve, and it looks like it will be a warm one as highs return
to the 60s. Christmas Day will feature high temperatures in the mid-60s with a
mix of sun and clouds. A few showers will be possible, but most of us will
remain dry through the holiday!
