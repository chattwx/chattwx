Today will be different than yesterday. Expect cloudier skies and cooler
temperatures, but it will still be humid. Highs today will be around 80 with
times of rain showers (60%). There will be light showers/sprinkles during the
early morning, and then mid-morning through the afternoon, rain will be more
likely for areas west of I-75. A system will move up from the south across our
area. If you live east of I-75, you may still receive some on and off showers,
but they'll be more sporadic. Today's rainfall in most cases will be just rain,
but a few embedded thunderstorms will be possible.

Then, this pattern of on and off rain showers and thunderstorms will continue
throughout the work-week. Highs will be in the low 80s on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday. Temperatures will increase slightly to 85 on Thursday and Friday with
a partly sunny sky into between showers/storms. At this time, nothing organized
or severe is expected.

Total rainfall for today at about 0.1-0.25" with higher totals within any
thunderstorms. For the entire week, area-wide rainfall will average about 2".
