Good Wednesday afternoon. We have had a few storms this afternoon. We will see
those winding down this evening, and the skies will even clear a bit. You may be
able to get a good view of the ISS tonight for about 7 minutes starting at 10:16
eastern. Look just above the NE horizon. Temps this evening will be in the low
80s, and it will be muggy.

Friday will be hot and humid with a high of 90, and a heat index in the mid-90s.
We'll have some clouds building through the day, and MAY get one or two passing
showers in the afternoon.

Saturday will be about the same with a high of 90 and a few afternoon storms.

Sunday we will have a better chance for afternoon storms and temps will be a
little lower though the humidity will remain high.

Next week we will stay in the mid-80s with the humidity receding just a little
by the middle of the week. Each afternoon we will see some scattered showers and
storms.
