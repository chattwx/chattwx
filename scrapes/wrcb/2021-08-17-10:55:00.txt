All watches and warnings have been allowed to expire this evening. Skies will be
partly cloudy through the overnight. 

Wednesday will be hot and humid with a high of 90, and a slight chance for
isolated afternoon showers.

I expect a widespread round of afternoon showers and storms Thursday with the
high being limited to 86.

Friday and Saturday we will be in the mid 80s with scattered showers and storms
possible each day.

Sunday into next week we can expect drier weather with heat and humidity
settling in. Highs will be in the low 90s at least through mid week.
