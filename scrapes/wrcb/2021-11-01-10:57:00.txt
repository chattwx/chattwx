Happy Monday, everyone!

Our Monday will feature some of the warmest temperatures we will see for the
entire week. That's right, it only goes downhill from here.

Look for plenty of sunshine this afternoon with highs warming into the upper
60s! Tonight, mostly clear skies return with overnight lows dropping back down
into the 40s. Tuesday will feature a mix of clouds and sunshine with highs
slightly cooler, only in the lower 60s. A dry front moves through late Tuesday,
ushering in a reinforcing shot of cooler temperatures. Highs on Wednesday will
be about 10 degrees cooler, only averaging in the lower 50s. 

The front stalls, as a wave of energy moves along it, bringing increasing clouds
Wednesday, with shower chances returning Wednesday night. Widespread showers
will be likely Thursday, along with plenty of cloud cover. Highs on Thursday
will likely not get out of the 40s in most locations. Brrr!

The upcoming weekend looks nice and quiet, but it will be chilly. Highs in the
50s, and lows down into the low to mid 30s. In fact, looks like we could see
several threats for widespread frost & freeze conditions by this weekend, so
planters beware! Highs will rebound back into the lower 60s with sunshine next
week, but that's still a few degrees below normal for this time of the year.

Enjoy the pleasant weather this afternoon!
