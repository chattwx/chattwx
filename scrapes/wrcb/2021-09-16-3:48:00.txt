Good Thursday. We may get another few showers through 8 pm, then mostly cloudy
skies with temps in the mid to low 70s through the evening.

Friday will be similar with temps ranging from 69 to 81 and cloudy skies all
day. Again, we will probably see a few spotty showers here and there.

Saturday and Sunday we will see more coverage of scattered showers and
thunderstorms, and they will be possible any time of day. Highs will remain
around 80.

Monday and Tuesday we will have highs in the upper 70s and scattered afternoon
showers and storms.

Wednesday a cold front will move through and bring widespread storms to the
area. Behind that front, we will get a shot of amazing weather Thursday (the
first full day of fall) with temps starting in the mid to upper 50s, highs in
the mid-70s, and lots of sunshine and low humidity!!
