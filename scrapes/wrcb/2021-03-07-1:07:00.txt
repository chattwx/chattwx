We will continue to see pleasant weather continuing through much of this coming
week. Skies will be sunny on Monday as highs climb into the mid and upper 60's.
Tuesday will be even warmer with highs near 70 and more sunshine. Wednesday will
continue warm with a few high clouds arcing across the skies and highs in the
low 70's.

Thursday will continue warmer with highs in the mid-'70s and clouds increasing.
Friday will be mostly cloudy with warmer highs in the mid to upper 70's.

This weekend will start off very warm with highs approaching 80 and showers
developing late in the day or at night. Sunday will see showers ending and a
cooler high in the mid-'60s. Paul Barys
