Scattered showers and storms will continue this evening before winding down
tonight. Isolated heavy downpours with frequent lightning will be the primary
concern. Lows will range from 67-72 degrees.

Another round of showers and storms will develop tomorrow as a cold front stalls
out over the area. Temperatures will be about 10 degrees below average due to
thick cloud cover. Localized flooding will be the primary threat for your
Monday.

It looks like the frontal boundary will hang around the area through much of
next week, sparking showers and storms each afternoon. Rain chances will be
slightly lower by the middle of the week which will allow temperatures to return
to the upper 80s.
