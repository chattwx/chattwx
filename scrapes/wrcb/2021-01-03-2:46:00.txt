For those in Chattanooga and westward or in Andrews, NC, you're already seeing
the sun. The cloud deck will continue to break and clear from west to east for
the rest of the day, making for a mostly clear Sunday evening. It'll drop from
the 40s into the upper 30s after sunset - a quiet and cool end to the first
weekend of 2021. Overnight will be mostly clear with lows in the upper 20s to
low 30s. A few areas of patchy fog may develop in the early morning hours.

Monday will be mostly sunny early with more clouds arriving for late afternoon
into the evening. Highs will be in the low 50s. Monday night into Tuesday will
have a few isolated showers. Tuesday will have a mix of sun and clouds with a
high near 54. High thin clouds move in for Wednesday with high temperatures
around 50. Then, the rest of the week will be cooler with highs only in the 40s
for Thursday through next Sunday. Scattered rain showers start on Thursday and
continue on Friday with a little wintry mix in the mountains. Saturday will be
dry with a partly sunny sky.
