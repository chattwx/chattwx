Happy Thursday! The nice weather has arrived, thanks to a cold front that pushed
through last night. High temperatures will range from 78-82 degrees with low
humidity. Winds will be out of the north at 10-15 mph gusting to 20-25 mph this
afternoon. It certainly will be a great day to get out and enjoy everything that
the Tennessee Valley has to offer.

Skies will remain clear tonight with lows ranging from 55-60 degrees. Friday
will be very similar to today. Highs will top out in the lower-80s along with
low humidity and sunny skies. Temperatures will begin to rebound this weekend.
We will return to the upper-80s by Sunday with increasing humidity. Dry weather
will be around through Sunday evening, making for another great weekend for
outdoor plans!
