It will be an active Sunday morning with a strong line of storms moving across
the area from west to east. The primary threats with these will be damaging
straight line wind and torrential rainfall (hail and brief tornado are lower
risk) on the front edge of the system. Grundy County in TN and Jackson and
DeKalb Counties in AL are under a Tornado Watch until 7/6am CT. All other TN
counties and Cherokee Co in NC are under a Severe Thunderstorm Watch until 9/8am
CT. Additionally, the same counties have a Flash Flood Watch until 8/7pm CT
tonight. As of now, no watches are in effect for Georgia.

Rainfall will end in our eastern counties by late morning, and then Sunday
afternoon will have quieter weather. It'll be in the low 60s with clouds slowly
decreasing, becoming partly cloudy by evening. Afternoon wind will be from the
northwest at 10-15mph.

After a busy weather weekend, Monday will be a fabulous day. Sunny skies with
highs in the mid-60s. Tuesday will be warm in the low 70s and partly sunny with
clouds increasing late. Wednesday will be another rainy day. Then much cooler
temperatures follow. Thursday and Friday will have lows in the 30s and highs in
the 50s.
