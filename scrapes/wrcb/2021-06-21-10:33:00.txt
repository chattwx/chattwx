We saw a pretty good dousing of rain Monday evening. We should be fairly quiet
save a remote shower or two until about 2am. Then we will have another round of
heavy rain and lightning (and maybe gusty winds) to take us through the early
morning hours of Tuesday.

After about 8am our weather will turn dramatically for the better. The front
will be passed, and we will enjoy cooler and drier air for the better part of
your Tuesday. Highs will only make it to the upper 70s and low 80s.

Wednesday will be just as nice with low humidity. Temps will range from a much
cooler 61 in the morning to a warm but dry 87 in the afternoon.

Thursday and Friday we are in the upper 80s and the humidity will start building
back in.

It will be muggy in the upper 80s also for the weekend with a chance for some
scattered showers and storms both Saturday and Sunday.
