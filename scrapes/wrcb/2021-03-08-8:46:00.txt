A remarkable March pattern continues all week for the Tennessee Valley.

It's also the last cold morning in the low 30s for at least the next week. Each
morning will get a bit better temperature wise each day this week.

Sunshine and light winds are expected today. Highs will be 5 to 10 above normal
for early March in the upper 60s to near 70 both today and Tuesday.

Highs will warm 10 to 15 above normal Wednesday through Friday, and nearly 20
above normal by this weekend.

Next rain chance looks light during the day on Saturday. Sunday to Monday of
next week could bring a better shot at measurable rainfall of 1" to 1.5" with
the next cold front approaching. Until then, this week provides an excellent
time to start outdoor vegetable seeds since we're 4 to 6 weeks out from the last
Spring Frost. This includes, Peas, Carrots, Radishes, and Spinach.

The Waning Crescent Moon becomes just a slither on Wednesday morning. Early
around 6:06 to 6:30am, catch the quartet of the moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and
Saturn low in the east southeastern sky.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunshine, 56
