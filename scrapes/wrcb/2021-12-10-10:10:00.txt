T.G.I.F, everyone! It's a cloudy, drizzly, and foggy day around the area. Cool
air is trying to hang tough around the region, but a warm front arrives later
this evening & tonight, bringing rising temps and setting the stage for a stormy
Saturday.

First, the rest of our Friday will feature clouds and spotty showers.
Temperatures will climb thru the 50s into the afternoon hours. This evening, the
warm front lifts north bringing 60s back to the area, along with more scattered
showers and maybe a few rumbles into the overnight hours. Winds will become
breezy out of the south between 10-20 mph.

Saturday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. It will begin with clouds and a few
scattered showers, but a line of strong to severe storms will be organizing to
our west, and will begin to approach the area from the west between 8am-2pm.

During this time, winds could gust up to 40-60 mph along the leading edge of the
line leading to some potential isolated wind damage and power outages. The
strongest storms & severe threat should exit the area by mid-afternoon Saturday,
leading to showers and cooler weather returning. In fact we're back into the 30s
by Sunday morning, with highs struggling to hit the low 50s.

Next week looks mainly quiet with a mix of clouds & sunshine, and mild temps.
Highs will be in the 60s and lows in the 30s and 40s.

Have a great Friday afternoon!
