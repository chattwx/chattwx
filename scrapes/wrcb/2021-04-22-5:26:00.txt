Good Thursday. With temps near or below freezing this morning we are looking at
areas of frost. Hopefully, the plants did okay last night. No problems this
afternoon as highs climb into the low to mid 60s under mostly sunny skies.

Tonight we will see temps in the upper 30s. Frost is not as high a risk, however
McMinn County east into the Blue Ridge will have temps in the low to mid 30s so
frost could be an issue.

Friday morning we will have a few rain showers moving through. Skies will be
partly cloudy in the afternoon with a high of 70.

Overnight we will have heavy rain and thunderstorms moving through. I don't
think severe weather is a big threat. However, we may get a few strong storms in
the early afternoon south near Rome and Calhoun, GA that will need watching.
Heavy rain through about 10 am will be the biggest issue. We will continue to
see widely scattered showers through the afternoon, ending during the evening.
1"-2" of rain will fall through the day.

Sunday we will clear out and have amazing weather with sunshine and an afternoon
high of 75. We will warm into the 80s next week.
