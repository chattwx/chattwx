We will have another cold night with lows in the mid to upper 20's and pretty
much clear skies. Clouds will be slowly increasing for Thursday as highs climb
into the mid 50's. The cloud cover will thicken Thursday night with a warmer low
in the low 40's. Friday looks quite wet with rain especially in the afternoon
and nighttime hours. Amounts will vary between a half inch to an inch. 

There is a chance some brief showers will occur north and east of the city
Saturday morning, but skies will turn partly cloudy to clear by afternoon and
evening. Highs will be in the low 50's. Sunday should see a few more clouds late
with highs in the 50's. On Monday it should be cloudy with highs near 50.
Tuesday and Wednesday will be partly sunny with highs in the 50's. Paul Barys
