Heat index values are already pushing 100 degrees this afternoon as temperatures
continue to climb into the 90s. Skies will remain mostly sunny for the remainder
of the day for most areas. However, a few pop-up showers will be possible
between 3-8 PM this evening.

Rain chances will be slightly higher on Thursday as more moisture sets up over
the Tennessee Valley. The best time frame for rain will be during the late
afternoon and early evening hours. Temperatures will still be quite hot as highs
range from 88-93 degrees.

A hot, humid pattern will persist into the weekend with highs reaching the
lower-90s each afternoon. Afternoon showers and storms will be around, but the
coverage will not be very high.

In the tropics, there are several disturbances that we are keeping an eye on.
The most intriguing is an area of low pressure in the Caribbean. This area of
low pressure could potentially become our next named storm, Ida. Impacts to the
Gulf Coast will be possible early next week. It is still too early for any
specifics, but we will keep you updated as new model data becomes available.
