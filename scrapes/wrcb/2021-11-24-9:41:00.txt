Happy Wednesday, everyone! Our Pre-Thanksgiving weather is looking pretty good
this afternoon. Look for partly sunny skies, milder afternoon temperatures, and
a light south wind. Highs should warm into the mid to upper 50s.

Tonight, look for a few clouds to roll back into the area. Partly cloudy, but
still cold. Overnight lows will drop into the 30s.

Thanksgiving Day is looking cold & dry to start. Morning temperatures will be in
the 30s, but should warm thru the 40s into the upper 50s to near 60 by
mid-afternoon. Clouds will be on the increase through most of the day, but
should be primarily dry. Light rain chances start to increase across the Plateau
region around 2-3pm, with scattered showers moving across the Valley between
5pm-11pm Thursday Evening. Rainfall amounts look to remain fairly light, in the
0.25" or less range for most. Winds will also pick up ahead of the front, so
look for a breezy afternoon in spots.

Thursday night the front clears the area, bringing a quick end to any leftover
shower activity. Look for blustery & colder air to begin to flow back into the
area. Overnight lows will bottom out in the low to mid 30s.

If you're going to be hitting the stores for any Black Friday specials, make
sure you bring the full winter gear. It's going to be a blustery and cold day
with highs only in the 40s.

This weekend will feature a mix of clouds & sunshine with highs in the 50s and
lows in the 20s and 30s.

Have a great Wednesday afternoon!
