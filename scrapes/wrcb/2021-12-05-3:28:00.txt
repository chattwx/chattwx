Happy Sunday! Skies will remain overcast through this evening with a few
sprinkles possible. Tonight will feature cloudy skies with lows ranging from
54-58 degrees.

Widespread rain will arrive between 6-11 AM Monday as a cold front approaches
from the west. A few isolated strong storms will be possible along the cold
front, but it is a low-end chance. Conditions will improve by the afternoon
hours with temperatures dropping into the 50s as the front passes. Skies will
clear Monday night, and temperatures will fall into the lower-30s.

Tuesday will be much colder with highs topping out in the upper-40s under partly
cloudy skies. A few showers will be possible Wednesday morning, but both
Wednesday and Thursday will be mainly dry.

Our next chance of rain will be late Friday into the weekend as a low-pressure
system approaches the region. Up to an inch of rain will be possible through
Sunday morning. Temperatures will once again turn warmer heading into the
weekend.
