Good Thursday. We will enjoy some nice spring-like weather for the rest of the
week. Highs will climb into the mid-60s today and Friday. Skies will be mostly
sunny both days.

Saturday we will have rain showers on and off through the day. It will be very
warm, so it is just rain we will have. Temps will range from 52 in the morning
to 61 in the afternoon. The rain will taper off through the late afternoon and
evening.

Sunday will be mild and dry with highs making it into the upper 50s. We will
have partly cloudy skies most of Sunday. We can expect some additional light
rain showers late Sunday night into the overnight hours of Monday morning. Total
rainfall amounts this weekend will range between .25" and .5".

Next week temps will chill out once again. Lows will drop into the 30s and highs
will be in the upper 40s and low 50s all week. The only precipitation will be
rain showers Wednesday night with some of that rain possibly turning to a light
wintry mix overnight into early Thursday morning.
