Good Morning, 

As clouds increase today, temperatures will be a tad cooperative reaching 87-89Â°
today.

THIS EVENING

Showers will arrive by 5PM-7PM this evening, and increase in coverage by
9PM-10PM. Dried River Birches should love the rain coming tonight - I know ours
are dried up from this stretch of 90s.

FRIDAY

The cold front is on track to arrive in Chattanooga by 10AM-12PM tomorrow. This
means, it will be warm, humid, and damp, with showers still likely ongoing for
morning drive time Friday - especially for the GA/AL communities.

I am still seeing the highest rain totals in our southern communities from this
event. With Chattanooga getting 0.50" to 1", and areas such as Chattooga,
Gordon, Gilmer, Murphy, Fannin, and DeKalb getting closer to 2" to 3" on Friday
morning.

FRIDAY PM -end storm alerting

The pattern will start up pleasant by Friday evening. The lower humidity will be
welcomed just in time for the holiday weekend. Actual 4th of July it looks sunny
with a high of 90. Humidity will rise back up on Monday of next week, with rain
chances returning by Tues-Wed.

TODAY:

12PM: M. Cloudy, 85 (Heat Index 90)

3PM: Isolated showers west, 87 (Heat Index, 91)

6PM: Rain and thunderstorms increasing west, 82 (Heat index, 84)
