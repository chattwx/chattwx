Humidity has risen a bit out there overnight. While not as cool as Wednesday
morning, it will still be a fabulous June morning for a walk/run.

Sunshine this morning will be followed by a partly cloudy sky in the afternoon.
It will be a great day to head to the pool and lakes nearby. A southeast wind
may increase, bringing light chop on the water, but highs will reach 87-88Â° -
making it a fabulous June day.

Friday will be hot in the afternoon, reaching 90, and the rain chance is
lowering for the upcoming weekend. Enjoy the outdoor events and water nearby -
that the Tennessee Valley offers.

Next week will provide more rain chances as we head into July.

6AM: Clear, a little humid, 67
