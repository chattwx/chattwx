Good Tuesday afternoon. It's another hot one with high humidity taking us
through the evenings. Temps will fall through the 80s this evening with MAYBE a
stray shower or two popping up.

The temps will be a little lower, but the humidity higher Wednesday with cloudy
skies and a high of 86. While we may get a stray shower or two in the morning
and afternoon, our best chance for showers and storms will be in the evening.

Thursday will see temps again in the mid-80s with high humidity, cloudy skies,
and only a few pop-up storms.

Friday I think we may have more widely scattered showers and storms as a front
moves through. I don't expect severe weather, but heavy rain and lightning are
certainly possible.

For the weekend we will be hot and muggy with highs near 90, mostly cloudy
skies, and a few showers and storms mainly during the afternoon hours.

If you want to see the space station it will be visible in the northern sky
about 15 degrees above the horizon for about 1 minute Wednesday morning at
3:02am.
