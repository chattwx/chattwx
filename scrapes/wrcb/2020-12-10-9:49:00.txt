It will be a great afternoon to head outside, as temperatures climb to the mid
60s today. It will be mostly clear and rain-free through Friday, making it an
excellent time for looking at holiday lights, heading to Christmas Tree Farms,
and Ice on the Landing.

The weather pattern begins to get active for the next week, beginning Saturday,
which is still looking wet.

Showers arrive 6AM-8AM, with moderate rain picking up in the afternoon and
evening. It will be cooler by Monday, with another wave arriving, bringing
mainly showers but a few mountain flurries early. Top temps Monday will only be
in the upper 40s.

We'll be watching for Wednesday-Thursday of next week, as rain, and the best
chance for any winter precip, would arrive then.

TODAY:

12PM: M. Sunny, 54

3PM: Sunny, 66

6PM: M. Clear, 57
