Saturday will be warm and humid with a partly sunny to mostly cloudy sky. Highs
will be in the mid to upper 80s - 88 in Chattanooga. The morning hours will have
a few spotty showers, primarily affecting our northern TN communities and
Cherokee County in NC. Then, we'll have scattered showers and storms developing
from lunch time into the early evening (peak timing: 12-5pm ET). Keep this in
mind if you'll be shopping along the World's Longest Yard Sale or spending the
day on the boat with a plan b to head inside. Then, activity will dwindle down
for the rest of Saturday evening. Overnight lows will be in the mid to upper
60s.

Sunday will be hot, humid, and mostly sunny. Highs will be around 90 with heat
index values from 93-95. Monday will take it up a couple of degrees with highs
in the low 90s, and heat index maxing out near 96-97. Both days will have very
limited rain chances. Beginning Tuesday through the rest of the work-week, each
day will have hit and miss showers/storms, highs around 90, and muggy - a very
typical summertime pattern.
