We're still stuck in the same weather pattern of muggy air and hit and miss
showers and storms. It will last through Friday with a bit of a break for the
weekend, and then clearer weather for next week.

Today will begin with areas of patchy fog and small, spotty showers. The showers
will be more likely along the Cumberland Plateau. Rain/storm chances will then
increase by about 10am, moving west to east through the afternoon and into the
evening. It'll be a mostly cloudy day with peeks of blue sky and sunshine. Highs
in the low 80s. Thursday will pretty much be a repeat of the same weather.
Friday will be slightly different with a partly sunny sky and scattered
showers/storms at 50%. Highs rising to the mid-80s. Remember, not every location
will have rain every day, but where showers/storms do develop, they will be
efficient rain producers. Localized flooding will be our biggest concern with an
additional 1-2" of rainfall on average from now through Friday.

Saturday will have a mix of sun and clouds with scattered showers/storms - highs
in the upper 80s. Sunday will be mostly sunny, humid, and hot (highs near 90)
with only an isolated shower chance.
