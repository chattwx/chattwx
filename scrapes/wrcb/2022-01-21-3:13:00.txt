Good morning and happy Friday! Today will be a cold day all around. Kicking it
off with below freezing temperatures, watch out for a few patchy areas of black
ice on elevated surfaces and roads that did not get much wind yesterday to dry
up residual water. Today will be cloudy with highs only in the low to mid-30s.
Wind will be light from the northeast at 5-10mph. There is a slim chance for a
few flurries today, particularly in the eastern mountains. Then, tonight will be
very cold with clearing clouds and lows in the upper teens to low 20s. Remember
to bring in your pets and use space heaters safely.

Sunshine will return on Saturday with a mostly sunny sky and highs in the low
40s. Sunday will still begin in the 20s, warming up a bit to 48 in the afternoon
with lots of sun. Monday will reach the low 50s before we have another cool
down. Tuesday will bring chances for scattered showers with highs back in down
in the 40s, and they'll stay there for the rest of the week.
