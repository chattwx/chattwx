Good Monday. We will again be clear and cool this evening with temps dropping
into the 50s as you head out for your Monday evening. We will keep dropping
overnight into the low 40s with temps in the Blue Ridge making it into the mid
to upper 30s again.

Tuesday will be mostly sunny to partly cloudy and after a cool start, we will
manage to rebound under sunny skies to a high of 74. Wednesday we will have a
few more clouds with the high launching to 76 ahead of our next front.

Thursday the front will bring clouds and spotty on and off showers throughout
the day. We will be a little humid and the cloud cover will tighten up our
temperature profile a bit. Temps will range from 59 in the morning to 73 in the
afternoon.

Friday will be mostly cloudy with a spotty afternoon shower or two. We will
start warm at about 60 and climb to 73. Saturday will also reach 73 with a few
showers in the afternoon. Sunday looks to be partly cloudy with a morning low of
55 and a high in the afternoon of 74.
