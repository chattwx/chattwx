It will come close to the record high today. I'm forecasting
81, and the record high is 81 from 2005. After a morning low
of 56, it is possible under a mostly sunny sky.

After nearly two weeks with no rain in the Tennessee Valley,
some areas will get a little rain tomorrow, followed by more
widespread rainfall and a few thunderstorms Wednesday.

The warmth continues through this period though, as dew
points will be rising. Tomorrow dew points will creep up to
the 60s, and then 70s on Wednesday. It will be humid
midweek.

Rainfall amounts from Tuesday-Wednesday will range from
0.50" to 1" west of I-75 to 1.5" to 2" east. Highest totals
during this period will be in eastern Polk, Cherokee, and
Monroe counties.

A cold front arrives Thursday, bringing temperatures and dew
points back to normal for November with highs in the 60s
Friday, and lows in the 40s Friday night.
