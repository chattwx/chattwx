Today will still be warm with highs from 75-80, but we'll have a lot more clouds
compared to yesterday. It'll be mostly cloudy with a few waves of brief, light
isolated showers. However, the great majority of the day will be dry. Then,
about 7pm, scattered light showers will arrive from the west. 

More significant scattered showers and storms will happen from about 1am to 1pm
on Monday. Severe weather is not expected, but a few of these may become strong.
Morning lows will be mild in the low 60s. Then, Monday afternoon will be quieter
with only isolated storm cells and some breaks in clouds. Highs will be warm in
the low 80s.

Tuesday will be a Storm Alert Weather Day with on and off widespread storms. As
of now, the primary threats look to be hail and damaging wind gusts. Our entire
area has been placed under a Level 2 Slight risk for scattered severe storms
possible by the Storm Prediction Center. Rain will continue through Wednesday
morning. Total rainfall at 1.5-3" so we'll need to watch for isolated flooding,
too.

Thursday and Friday will have more sun than clouds, an isolated shower, and
cooler highs in the upper 60s to low 70s.
