It's certainly not as cold this Thursday morning as previous days, and our
warming trend continues with afternoon highs over 10 degrees above normal,
ranging from 63-68. Thursday will be partly sunny with a few times during the
day mostly cloudy. Another pleasant December day with wind from the south at
5-12mph.

Tonight a front will dip close enough to our area to bring a few isolated
showers generally north of Chattanooga from Thursday evening into Friday
morning. Overnight lows will be mild in the low to mid-50s.

Friday will be mostly cloudy, and temperatures will continue to rise to the
upper 60s. Saturday will have periodic scattered showers throughout the day with
highs near 68. The rain will be from a cold front. It won't be as powerful of a
system as last weekend, but a few rumbles of thunder may mix in with 0.25-1" of
rainfall. Sunday will then be much colder with highs only in the upper 40s and
some sunshine.
