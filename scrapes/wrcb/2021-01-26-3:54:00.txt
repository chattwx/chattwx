Good Tuesday. As the rain continues to move on we will have a mild morning with
areas of dense fog through the morning drive. Late morning into the afternoon we
will see the sun returning with highs getting into the mid 60s.

More clouds move in tonight through Wednesday. I do expect more scattered
showers on and off through the day Wednesday with some of the showers even
changing to a light wintry mix during the evening / night time hours. Highs
Wednesday will be around 60. Skies will clear Wednesday night as colder air
moves in. Temps will drop into the low 30s by Thursday morning.

Thursday will pretty chilly all day. We will only make it to the mid 40s. Friday
will be seasonably cool with temps ranging from 28 in the morning to 52 in the
afternoon.

For the weekend we will warm to 52 Saturday with rain showers Saturday night
into Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon the showers should be over and we will
warm to a high of 53.
