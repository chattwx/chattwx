The tropical system that we have been tracking for most of the week is now
onshore bringing heavy rain to the Gulf Coast. As the system tracks inland,
clouds will be on the increase across the Tennessee Valley this morning. Showers
will begin to overtake our Alabama and Georgia communities this afternoon.
Pockets of heavy rain will push across these areas later this evening with
localized flooding possible. Areas to the north of the Tennessee border
including Chattanooga will have lower impacts with only sporadic light rain
expected later today. The latest high-resolution forecast model indicates that
most of the rain will be out of the region just in time for your Father's Day
festivities.

The break from the rain will be short-lived as a cold front approaches the area
late Monday into early Tuesday. Another round of heavy rain and the potential
for a few strong storms will push through ahead of the front. Conditions will
improve by Tuesday afternoon with cooler temperatures on the way for the middle
of the week.
