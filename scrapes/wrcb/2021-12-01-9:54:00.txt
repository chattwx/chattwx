Happy Wednesday, everyone! We're looking at some nice sunshine across the area
today. A few high clouds will stroll in this afternoon, helping to filter out
some of the sun. Otherwise, look for a mild afternoon with high temps climbing
into the mid to upper 60s.

Overnight, scattered clouds will help slow the drop in temps across the area.
Morning low temperatures will likely only bottom out in the 40s.

Thursday will feature pleasant weather conditions. We're expecting mostly sunny
skies and well above average temps. Highs on Thursday will likely be around 70
degrees!

Friday will feature even more sunshine, and likely the warmest temps of the
week. Highs will likely warm past the 70 degree mark.

Small changes arrive this weekend with partly cloudy skies and slightly cooler
temps. Highs will be in the 60s with morning lows in the mid to upper 40s.

A more active weather pattern looks to develop next week with a few systems
bringing some rain chances back to the region. The first arrives with scattered
showers on Monday, but a stronger system could provide some beneficial rainfall
by next Wednesday.

Have a great rest of your Wednesday!
