Good Tuesday. We are off to a rainy start this morning with rain and a few
non-severe thunderstorms through mid-morning. The rain is training in from the
southwest and could create ponding on the roadways for the morning commute. Go
slow. This afternoon the rain will end and skies will be cloudy with highs in
the low 60s.

Wednesday we will have some showers and thunderstorms in the morning. Some of
those storms may become severe over north Alabama through the day Wednesday. We
will have on and off showers and storms throughout the day. Highs will make it
to the upper 60s.

Late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning we will have a line of strong
to severe storms moving through the Tennessee Valley. Heavy rain, hail, damaging
winds, and even isolated tornadoes are going to be possible during that time
period.

Thursday afternoon we will start to clear out with a high of 65.

Friday through the weekend will be much cooler with lows in the 30s and highs in
the upper 50s and low 60s.
