Conditions will remain quiet tonight as temperatures slowly fall into the lower
70s during the overnight hours. Things will change tomorrow afternoon as a cold
front approaches the region. Monday will be a Storm Alert Weather Day due to the
potential for spotty strong to severe storms. The Storm Prediction Center has
placed most of the Tennessee Valley under a marginal (level 1/5) risk for severe
storms tomorrow. The primary threat will be damaging wind gusts. The tornado
threat will be low but not impossible. The current time frame for severe storms
looks to be between 3-11 PM.

The approaching cold front will exit to our east early Tuesday morning which
will end any severe threat. Much cooler temperatures along with lower humidity
will be in store for the middle of the week.
