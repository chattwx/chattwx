Another beautiful day is on tap for Wednesday, with sunny skies as highs climb
into the low 70's along with a southwest breeze. Thursday will be partly cloudy
with highs in the mid 60's. On Friday clouds will be increasing as the chance
for rain increases rapidly. Highs will be cooler and in the mid 50's.

This weekend looks wet at times with highs in the low 60's Saturday and near 70
on Sunday. Showers will be likely. The chance for more showers on Monday and
Tuesday will remain high with highs in the low to mid 60's. Paul Barys
