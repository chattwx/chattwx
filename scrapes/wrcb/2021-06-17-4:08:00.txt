Once again, we're beginning the day with pleasant temperatures in the 60s in the
Chattanooga metro and 50s beyond. It'll warm up quickly, hitting around 80 for
lunch time with highs today from 85-89 for most. It'll be a sunny day with
scattered fair weather clouds developing in the afternoon. Tonight will be clear
with lows from 60-65.

The heat will build back up on Friday with highs in the low 90s and a mostly
sunny sky. Saturday will have increasing high clouds with highs in the mid to
upper 80s with isolated PM showers/storms (20%).

Then, comes our unsettled pattern. We know that Sunday through Tuesday will have
active weather - first with tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and second
with a cold front passing Monday night into Tuesday. What we don't know are the
exact details, especially related to the potential tropical system. This
includes timing and the exact path. At this time, your takeaways should be to go
ahead and plan for times of rain and storms on Father's Day, especially if you
live in Georgia or Alabama.
