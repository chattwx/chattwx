After dense fog this morning, sunshine is with us for the next few hours. Clouds
will roll in this afternoon, with highs near 55-56 under light winds.

Tonight will be about 10 degrees milder near 40, thanks to more cloud cover.

Tomorrow will bring a very small rain chance to those east of I-75 and near
Cherokee county, NC in the morning. Only a trace to a few hundredths of an inch
of rain are expected. A few mountain flurries are possible, but overall, no
winter weather is expected.

The next weather maker comes Thursday night into Friday morning. This will be
all liquid as well, bringing 0.50" to 0.75" by Friday morning. Surface
temperatures Friday morning will be in the mid to upper 30s.

TODAY:

12PM: P. Cloudy, 45

3PM: Increasing clouds west, 56

6PM: M. Cloudy, 50
