The rainy weather continues today with periods of light to moderate rainfall and
at times heavy. Southwestern Hamilton County, including Chattanooga, Red Bank,
and East Brainerd, is under a Flood Warning until 12pm ET, so please be careful
driving. Also, most of our counties are under a Flash Flood Watch until this
evening. Another 1-2" of rainfall will be possible today. Since the ground is
already saturated from Saturday and Sunday, today's additional rainfall may lead
to localized flooding. Be especially aware of standing water on roads, low-lying
areas, and rises to small streams. Monday's temperatures will remain in the 70s.

Showers will decrease overnight, becoming scattered, and the scattered activity
will continue on Tuesday with some breaks in the clouds in the afternoon. Highs
in the upper 70s to low 80s. Then, a cold front will pass on Wednesday morning.
We'll have showers and probably some storms early Wednesday morning through
lunch. Clouds will then partially clear for Wednesday afternoon, and cooler,
drier air will move in - perfect timing for the first day of Fall. The rest of
the week will have lows in the upper 40s to low 50s and highs in the 70s with
sunshine!
