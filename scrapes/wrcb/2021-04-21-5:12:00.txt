Good Wednesday. We are starting out with some light sprinkles on the plateau as
a cold front works through today. The main impact will be cold and windy weather
moving in. Skies will clear by lunchtime as winds kick up to 15-25 mph from the
NW. Skies will be sunny, and the high will only reach about 56.

Tonight parts of our area are under a FREEZE WARNING or a FROST ADVISORY. You
will want to protect the sensitive vegetation Thursday morning. We can expect
temps in the low 30s in the valley and upper 20s in the mountains. Thursday
afternoon will be nice with sunshine and highs in the mid-60s.

Friday will be cloudy with sporadic showers and temps ranging from 43 to 69.
Rain showers will intensify overnight Friday through Saturday. We will still
manage a high of 70 Saturday. The rain will end completely after about 8 PM.

Sunday looks good with a few clouds and highs in the low 70s. Monday will be
sunny and 80 degrees.
