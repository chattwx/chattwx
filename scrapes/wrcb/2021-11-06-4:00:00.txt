Temperatures will fall back into the upper-50s this evening under mostly sunny
skies. It will be another cold night as lows drop into the mid-30s. Frost
advisories will be in effect for most of the area from 3-9 AM Sunday. Be sure to
cover your outdoor plants to protect them from potential frost.

A warming trend will begin Sunday through Wednesday as highs return to 70
degrees by the middle of the week. Skies will remain mostly sunny, making for
great weather for outdoor activities.

Clouds will begin to build in throughout the day on Thursday ahead of our next
weather maker. Rain showers look to arrive Thursday evening and taper off Friday
morning as a cold front passes through the region. Temperatures will turn much
cooler heading into next weekend.

Don't forget to set those clocks back 1 hour before heading to bed tonight!
