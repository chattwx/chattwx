Tree pollen is better today in the "moderate range" and air quality is still in
the Moderate range today, too with an AQI of 60.

A few clouds will roll in this afternoon, but it will be a splendid day with
highs reaching 72-73.

It will clear again tonight and hopefully stay clear through Wednesday morning.
The quartet of the slither of the Waning Crescent, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn
will be visible between 6:06AM and 6:30AM EST on Wednesday morning! Look
east/southeast.

Still. Rain. Free.

While it's been dry for a week, outdoor burning is allowed today in Hamilton
County.

Isolated showers return Friday. At this time, the better chance looks to be
south of Chattanooga on Friday. Very little rain is expected Saturday and
Sunday, too. The next decent chance of measurable rain comes on Monday, and into
next week! Thunderstorms will be possible on Monday of next week, as well. Stay
tuned as Monday gets closer.

TODAY:

12PM: Increasing Clouds, 61

3PM: Broken Clouds, 71

6PM: M. Cloudy, 67
