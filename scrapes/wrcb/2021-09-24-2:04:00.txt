Good Friday! Let the excellent fall weather continue. No problems this evening.
Clear skies with temps falling through the 60s. You may want a light jacket if
you are doing Friday Night Football.

Saturday we will have some clouds early on, but we should clear out nicely
through the day with plenty of sunshine and temps ranging from a cool 50 in the
morning to 78 in the afternoon.

Sunday will be a great one also for the Ironman or whatever you have planned.
Skies will be sunny all day with temps in the low to mid-50s in the morning and
about 80 in the afternoon.

Next week we will warm up into the low to mid-80s with slightly higher humidity.
Still no rain in the forecast.

We are watching Hurricane Sam way out in the Atlantic. It will become a major
hurricane, but right now is too far out to tell what the track will be.
