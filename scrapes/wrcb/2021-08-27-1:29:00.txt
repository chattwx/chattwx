Good Friday! No problems with all the Friday night things going on. Skies will
be partly cloudy with temps falling from 87 at 7 PM to 81 by 10 PM.

The weekend looks good for the outdoors as well. Don't get me wrong. It will be
hot and muggy, but appropriately so for the end of August. Highs will hover
around 911 or 92 with a heat index in the mid-90s. I don't expect any rain over
the weekend.

Monday won't be too different. Highs will remain around 90, but we may get a
stray afternoon shower or storm.

The remnant of Ida looks like it could be a rainmaker for us Tuesday all day and
all day Wednesday as well. The 2-day rainfall total could approach 4" for a lot
of folks. The path of the storm is sure to shift at least a little, so keep
checking back. The rain will keep highs around 80 if even that.

Next Thursday and Friday look great. We will be dry with highs in the mid to
upper 80s, AND the humidity will be a little lower so it should be a nice start
to September for us.
