Thursday will once again be warm and humid. Highs will be above normal, near 85
this afternoon. The difference for today will come from cloud cover. Unlike the
previous days this week with sunny skies, today will be partly sunny to even
mostly cloudy at times. Overnight will be partly cloudy and mild with lows in
the low to mid-60s.

Friday will be similar with a partly sunny sky and highs near 85. Saturday will
have a bit more sunshine, especially in the morning, and highs from 80-84. Both
Friday and Saturday will have small chances for a couple of spotty showers,
primarily along area mountains.

Greater rain chances will then return on Sunday. Sunday morning should be mainly
dry with showers and a few storms developing in the afternoon and carrying into
Sunday night. The rain will continue on Monday ahead of a cold front. Even once
the front passes, we'll still have scattered showers Tuesday and onward for next
work-week. Highs will be cooler in the mid-70s.
