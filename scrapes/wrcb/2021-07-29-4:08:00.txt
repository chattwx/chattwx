For another day, we're starting off with patchy fog and mist in some valley
locations. It'll last until about 9am, and then the rest of the day is all about
the heat. Today will likely be the hottest day of this week with highs in the
mid to upper 90s - 98 in Chattanooga. The humidity will drop slightly for the
afternoon keeping the heat index around 100. We'll have lots of sunshine with
only a few clouds here and there. Then, this evening will be warm with clouds
increasing after midnight with lows from 70-75.

Friday will be partly cloudy and hot again with highs in the mid-90s. Humidity
will be higher, so Friday will have the highest heat indices of the week around
105. These levels are borderline for a heat advisory, so please use extra
caution if working/playing outside. There will also be a chance for a few
isolated showers associated with a "cold" front.

Saturday will be mostly sunny, highs near 94, and heat index around 100. We'll
get a bit of relief on Sunday with on and off showers/storms and highs in the
mid to upper 80s.
