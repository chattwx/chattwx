The wind chill this morning is in the low 20s and upper teens. I am seeing a
wind chill under 30Â° through noon today, too.

A few clouds this morning may obstruct viewing in the western sky as the Full
Wolf Moon is setting at 8:34AM this morning in the west/northwest horizon.

THIS WEEKEND:

Saturday morning, cold. Clouds late day. Rain arriving after 10PM.

Sunday morning, milder, low 40s with a south breeze picking up. Rain ongoing
through early afternoon. Sunday afternoon looks mild up to 60!

NEXT WEEK:

Colder temperatures are quick to move right back in Monday, bringing mountain
flurries and perhaps a dusting to the Cumberland Plateau by Monday morning.

TODAY:

6AM: Few Clouds, 27 (wind chill 21)

9AM: Few Clouds, 29 (wind chill 22)

12PM: Sunshine, 38 (wind chill 29)
