This nice December weather will continue right into the evening hours,
cooperating well for the couple of Christmas parades happening tonight.
Generally speaking, it'll be in the 50s when you're waiting for the parade to
start (5:00), but after sunset and during the parade, it'll be in the 40s.
Overnight will have scattered clouds with lows around freezing in Chattanooga
and below freezing outside of the city. Cherokee County expect low 20s.

Sunday will be partly sunny and highs near 55. Clouds will increase more in the
evening with a chance for a few light, spotty showers. Monday will be partly
sunny with isolated sprinkles, too, and the higher elevations may see a few snow
flurries. Highs will only be in the mid-40s with wind from the NNW. Tuesday will
become sunny with highs near 49. Wednesday will have some high thin clouds with
highs in the mid-50s. Thursday will be sunny and highs near 60. The work week
will end with broken cloud cover and highs around 60 on Friday. Showers will
then start-up Friday night with rain on Saturday.
