A Storm Alert Weather Day is still in effect as periods of heavy rain continue
to push across the Tennessee Valley. A Flash Flood Watch is in effect for most
of our area, excluding our easternmost counties through Monday evening. 1-4" of
additional rainfall will cause localized flooding through tomorrow night,
especially since the ground is already very saturated. Try to avoid flood-prone
areas if you plan on traveling over the next 24-36 hours.

Scattered showers and storms will continue into Tuesday, but the coverage will
be more hit and miss. High temperatures will remain around 80 degrees.

A cold front will push through the area early Wednesday, bringing showers for
the first part of the day. We will finally begin to clear out Wednesday
afternoon as much drier air filters into the area. The first day of fall is on
Wednesday, and it certainly will feel that way as highs top out in the mid-70s
with overnight lows ranging from 48-55 degrees across the Tennessee Valley.
Fall-like weather with plenty of sunshine will continue through the weekend!
