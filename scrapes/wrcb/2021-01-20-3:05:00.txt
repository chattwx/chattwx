Blue sky and sunshine return today. A few sprinkles and wintry mix will be
possible in our far eastern mountain counties until about 7am this morning.
Otherwise, today will be a dry day with a mostly sunny sky - nice January
weather. Lots of sunshine for the morning and early afternoon with highs around
50. Then, high clouds will start to move in from the west late afternoon and
cloud cover will increase through the evening hours. Overnight lows will be in
the upper 30s to 40 with light rain showers starting up around 2am. Those light
showers will continue Thursday morning, tapering off through the afternoon.
Highs will be in the upper 40s.

Friday will be mostly cloudy with times of light rain showers for our southern
counties. Highs will be mild in the mid-50s. Saturday looks to be a fantastic
day for the weekend with lots of sun and highs around 50. Sunday will be mostly
cloudy with PM scattered rain showers. Monday is shaping up to be a soaker with
about 2" of rain possible, maybe even a few thunderstorms. It'll be mild around
60. Tuesday will then be cooler with showers ending in the morning.
