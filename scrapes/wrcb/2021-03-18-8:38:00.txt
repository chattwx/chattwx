Good Thursday. The severe weather stayed to the west last night, and heavy rain
turned out to be the story. We were doused with 2" to 5" of rain.

We will see any remnant rain showers moving out through the morning, and by
lunchtime we will be dry with partly cloudy skies. It will be a little windy
from the SW at 10-15. Temps will be in the low to mid-60s through the day.

Friday will be cloudy, windy, and cooler. Temps will range from 46 in the
morning to 55 in the afternoon. Winds will blow from the north at 110-20.

The weekend will be awesome. Saturday will start at 42 and climb to 62 with
sunny skies. Sunday will start a little cooler in the mid-30s and make it to 62
for the high. Sunday will be sunny also.
