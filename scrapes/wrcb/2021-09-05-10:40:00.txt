I hope everyone has had a great weekend! An approaching cold front will spark
scattered downpours and a few thunderstorms as we head into the overnight hours.
Rainfall amounts will not be overly impressive, but a few locations may squeeze
out a quick inch of rainfall. The cold front will push to our south by tomorrow
morning, ending rain chances by about 7 AM. The rest of your Labor Day will
feature clearing skies and comfortable temperatures in the low to mid-80s.

Monday through Wednesday will feature high temperatures ranging from 84-88
degrees with tolerable humidity levels. A few showers will be around during the
afternoon hours with the best rain chance coming Wednesday. A reinforcing cold
front will bring a refreshing blast of fall-like air to wrap up the week.
