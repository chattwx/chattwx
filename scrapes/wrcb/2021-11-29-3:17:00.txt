Good morning after the long holiday weekend! As you get back into the work and
school groove, it'll be cold this morning in the 30s for most locations followed
by below normal highs in the upper 40s to 50. We will have sunny skies
throughout the day with only a few stray clouds here and there. Relative
humidity will be low today, so please use caution if you plan to burn anything
outside. Overnight will be clear with lows in the upper 20s to low 30s.

Tuesday starts our warming trend for mild high temperatures. Tuesday will be
mostly sunny and around 60. Wednesday will bump up to 65 with some high clouds
and sunshine. Thursday and Friday will both be near 68 and mostly sunny.

Saturday and Sunday will be partly sunny with highs not quite as warm in the
upper 50s to low 60s. Plus, a few chances for scattered rain showers both days.
