It's a colder morning with near 30-32° with calm winds. For our early risers,
watch for frost on the windshield and over some of our early blooming plants.

After a cool morning, this afternoon will be comparable to Saturday, with
sunshine and highs in the low 60s. For those east of I-75, watch for a northeast
breeze today. Winds could begin gusting 25-30 mph this afternoon, making it an
excellent time for a kite flying afternoon with the kiddos.

Due to a northeast breeze, and sunshine, pollen counts will remain high.

The quiet weather pattern will continue all next week, as temperatures continue
to warm each day. High temperatures starting Wednesday will be ~10 above normal
near 70, and up to 20 above normal by next weekend ~79-80°.

TODAY:

6AM: 32, Clear, Frosty,
