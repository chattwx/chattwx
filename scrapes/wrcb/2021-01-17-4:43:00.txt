Sunday will range from mostly cloudy to partly sunny, and it'll be a warmer day
with highs near 48 and a southwesterly breeze. Tonight into Monday morning a few
flurries will be possible in our northern higher elevations sweeping down into
Cherokee County in NC. For everyone else, it'll be mostly cloudy with lows near
freezing.

Monday will have a mix of sun and clouds with highs in the mid-40s. Tuesday will
have light isolated showers at only 0.1" and seasonable highs around 50.
Wednesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 50s. Scattered showers will
develop on Thursday. It'll be a mild day with highs in the mid-50s. The forecast
for Friday is changing as rain chances are decreasing with the newest data
keeping the heaviest rain to our south. Thus, as of now, I'm dropping Friday
down to scattered showers, but check back for updates if you have outdoor plans
for the end of the week. Highs will be in the low 50s.
