Good Morning,

Clouds will continue all day with sprinkles, especially near Georgia and Alabama
today. Only a few hundredths of an inch is expected.

Clouds will eventually clear out late, as a weak cold front moves through-really
early Wednesday. Sunshine will make a comeback tomorrow.

Showers however, return Thursday, bringing 0.10" to 0.25" by Thursday night. Any
shower activity Friday will stay south of Chattanooga, limited to those near
Floyd, Chattooga, Pickens, and DeKalb counties.

NEXT WEEK

Something to consider, as temperatures next week appear to be warming. A system
arriving Monday could bring the first big rain event for the Tennessee Valley.
Given milder temperatures, too, thunderstorms may be added to the forecast
Monday. Rain amounts of over 1" widespread looks possible at this time.

TODAY:

12PM: Cloudy, Sprinkles, 44

3PM: Cloudy, Sprinkles, 53

6PM: Cloudy, Sprinkles, 48
