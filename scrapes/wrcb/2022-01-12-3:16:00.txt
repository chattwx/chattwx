Good morning, Wednesday will begin very cold in the 20s, but by afternoon, it'll
be warmer than the past couple of days with highs in the low 50s. It'll be
mostly sunny overall with passing high clouds, especially in the afternoon.
Tonight will have increasing clouds and not as cold with lows from 30-35.

Thursday will have more clouds with a couple of PM isolated showers,
particularly in the higher elevations. It'll reach the low 50s. A few flurries
will be possible after sunset. Friday will be cooler again, highs near 47. Then,
comes our big weather focus -- the weekend.

A potent low pressure system will bring the chance for rain, snow, and wintry
mix to our area. There is still a lot of uncertainty on the exact track and
temperatures locally. As of now, Saturday looks to mainly be rain, especially in
the evening. Then, a transition to wintry mix and snow overnight and through the
day on Sunday as it becomes colder. Again, we'll be keeping a close eye on
temperatures for if and when it drops below freezing. Please, check back for
updates.
