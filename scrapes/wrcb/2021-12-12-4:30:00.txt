Good morning! Thankfully, we have calm weather for today and the next few days.
Thus, you can enjoy your plans outside, but just make sure you dress
accordingly. For today, that means layering up for winter temperatures again. We
begin Sunday morning in the 30s and afternoon highs will only be in the upper
40s to low 50s with a sunny sky. Clear skies tonight with calmer wind mean
Monday morning will be even colder with most locations at or below freezing.

Monday will be another sunny day with highs in the upper 50s. Tuesday will be
mostly sunny and warmer with highs in the low 60s. The warming trend will
continue on Wednesday and Thursday with highs at 66 and 68 respectively. Both
days will also feature more clouds for a partly sunny sky. Friday will likely be
the warmest day of the week with highs in the upper 60s, but it'll also have
scattered showers which will continue on Saturday, too.
