Happy Autumnal Equinox, the first day of the Astronomical Fall season! Before we
can get into the fall spirit with cool, crisp fall weather, we have to deal with
some morning rain first. The cold front is around the Murfreesboro area at 4am
ET. It'll move across our local communities from about 7-9am this morning. On
either side of the front are broken rain showers. Periodic showers, including
downpours, will happen from now until about noon from west to east. On average,
about 0.25" of rainfall is expected with a few localized bands of up to 1".
Clouds will then partially clear in the afternoon with a few sporadic light
showers and a northwest breeze at 10-20mph, gusts at 25. Humidity will also be
dropping. Afternoon highs today will be in the upper 60s to around 70 - say
hello to Fall.

Overnight will be mostly clear. Humidity will continue to fall, and lows will be
in the mid-40s to low 50s - jacket weather for Thursday morning. Thursday will
have a few remaining clouds in the morning, otherwise a sunny day with highs in
the upper 60s to low 70s. Friday will be another cool start from 45-50, sunny,
and highs in the low 70s. Saturday and Sunday will be a bit warmer in the mid to
upper 70s.
