I am expecting more sunshine for Wednesday along with highs in the mid to upper
40's. Skies should be clear for Wednesday night as lows drop into the upper
20's. Clouds will be increasing on Thursday as highs remain in the upper 40's.
On Friday in the early morning before sunrise we will see showers. They should
end in the early afternoon with highs in the upper 40's to near 50. Skies will
clear off into the late afternoon.

This weekend will see just a few clouds on Saturday with highs in the low 50's.
Sunday will see cloudy skies with some rain mixed with snow in the higher
elevations, especially in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Highs will be near 50.
Monday and Tuesday will be dry with highs in the 50's. Paul Barys
