The sunny weather will continue for the rest of the afternoon with cool
temperatures. Then, tonight will be a great time to cuddle up next to an outdoor
firepit with calm wind. It'll drop back down into the 30s by late evening with
overnight lows from 25-30.

Some high, thin clouds will move through Sunday morning, giving way to afternoon
sun. Highs will be a bit warmer in the mid-50s. Another great day for outdoor
plans. Clouds will then increase Sunday night with a few sprinkles possible by
about 10pm.

Spots of rain will increase during the early morning hours of Monday with the
main line of rain showers moving from west to east from about 6am to noon ET.
Then, clouds will partially clear with highs in the mid-50s. Tuesday will be
sunny and mild around 60. Wednesday looks to be a fantastic day in the mid-60s
and sunny. A few isolated showers will be possible Thursday morning, partly
sunny and 58 in the afternoon, and then, showers again Thursday night into
Friday morning. Friday will be around 54, and Saturday will have increasing rain
chances with highs near 50.
