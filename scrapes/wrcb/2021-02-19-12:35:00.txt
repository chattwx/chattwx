Cold air will settle in for tonight as the lows drop into the low 20's in the
city. I am expecting teens in most places, though. Saturday will be sunny and
cool as highs approach 50 with light winds. Saturday night will be clear and
cold with lows near 30, and 20's away from the city. Sunday will see a few high
clouds move in with highs near 60 and a southerly breeze.

Another shot of rain will move in for Monday with only a quarter of an inch
expected. Highs should be near 60. Tuesday will be sunny and a bit warmer with
low 60's expected. Wednesday will continue sunny with a warmer high in the mid
60's.

Thursday will see a few more clouds with highs near 60. By late in the day or
Thursday night some showers will move in. Friday will see some showers with a
small chance for a mix of rain/snow north of the city. Highs should be near 50.
