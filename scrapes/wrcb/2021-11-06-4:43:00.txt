Happy Saturday! Temperatures will start in the 30s this morning with areas of
patchy frost. Highs will range from 58-62 degrees by this afternoon under mostly
sunny skies. We will remain clear tonight as lows fall back into the mid to
upper-30s.

A warming trend will begin Sunday through Wednesday as highs return to near 70
degrees by the middle of the week. Skies will remain mostly sunny, making for
great weather for outdoor activities.

Clouds will begin to build in throughout the day on Thursday ahead of our next
weather maker. Rain showers look to arrive late Thursday evening and continue
into Friday morning as a cold front passes through the region. Temperatures will
turn much cooler heading into next weekend.

Don't forget to set those clocks back 1 hour before heading to bed tonight!
