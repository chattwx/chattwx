Happy Labor Day! If you're up early, we're dealing with showers primarily from
Marion Co in TN to Cherokee Co in NC and southward. The good news is that these
showers will mostly be done by 8am this morning. A few spotty ones will continue
for our far southeastern communities during the day, but overall, after 8am,
Labor Day will be dry. It'll remain mostly cloudy in the morning, becoming
partly sunny for the afternoon. Clouds will clear for areas northwest of
Chattanooga first. Highs from 80-84. Tonight will be mostly clear with lows from
60-65.

Tuesday and Wednesday will have a mix of sun and clouds with highs in the
mid-80s and a few isolated showers. Then a cold front will pass Wednesday night.
Temperatures will drop slightly, but the biggest difference will be a huge drop
in humidity. Thursday and Friday will be refreshing and comfortable with sunny
skies and highs in the low 80s. Saturday will still have low humidity, but it'll
be warmer in the mid-80s. Then, by Sunday, the humidity will be creeping back up
again with highs in the upper 80s and plenty of sunshine.
