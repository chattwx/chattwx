Enjoy the last bit of the holiday weekend with plentiful sunshine and above
normal temps this afternoon. The nice weather will continue into the evening in
the 40s after sunset with clouds increasing from the west. Overnight lows will
not be as cold as the past few mornings, in the low to mid-30s. A band of
scattered light showers will move across the area from west to east from about
4am Monday morning until noon. Any rain will be minimal at 0.1" or less. The
rest of Monday will be mostly cloudy with highs in the upper 40s to low 50s. 

Tuesday will be partly sunny and in the low 50s. Wednesday will have increasing
clouds to mostly cloudy, a high of 55, and a couple of isolated showers. Then,
our big active weather days for the week will be New Year's Eve and New Year's
Day. Expect rain on Thursday, especially Thursday night, and then ending on
Friday morning. Total rainfall at 1.5-3" to end 2020 and begin 2021. The
potential for flooding will be the primary threat although a few thunderstorms
can't be ruled out. It'll also be warmer with highs in the low 60s. Sunshine and
cooler temps return for the first weekend of 2021 with highs near 50 both
Saturday and Sunday.
