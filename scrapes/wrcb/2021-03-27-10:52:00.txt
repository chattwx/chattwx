Heading through the overnight we will be cloudy with only a sparse shower or
two, but no severe weather through the night. Temps will be in the low 60s all
night.

Palm Sunday morning we will have a cold front pushing in strong storms. A squall
line will move over the Cumberland Plateau between 5am and 7am. It will move
through the Tennessee Valley and northwest GA between 7am and 9am. And it will
move into the Blue Ridge Mtns. between 9am and 11am. After noon the storms will
be gone and we will be breezy and pleasant with highs in the mid 60s.

The storms tomorrow morning may become severe producing not only heavy rain and
lightning, but also damaging winds, hail, and even an isolated tornado can't be
ruled out. We could also see some flooding as we rack up another .5" to 1" of
rain.

Monday will be a great day with sunshine and temps ranging from 40 in the
morning to 65 in the afternoon.
