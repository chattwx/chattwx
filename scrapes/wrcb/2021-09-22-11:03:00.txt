Today is the Autumnal Equinox, known as the first day of Astronomical Fall! A
cold front passed through the region earlier this morning, bringing rain to much
of the area. The rain has now pushed to our east, but a few lingering showers
will be possible through 1 PM. Skies will begin clearing this afternoon and
widespread sunshine will arrive by this evening. Breezy and cool conditions will
continue for the rest of the day as high temperatures range from 66-70 degrees.
Tonight will feature clear skies and chilly temperatures with lows ranging from
45-51 degrees.

Thursday is setting up to be a gorgeous fall day with plenty of sunshine, low
humidity, and high temperatures around 70 degrees. A gradual warming trend will
continue into this weekend as highs slowly climb back to near 80 degrees by
Sunday. Sunshine will be around each day as rain chances remain near zero
through the middle of next week.
