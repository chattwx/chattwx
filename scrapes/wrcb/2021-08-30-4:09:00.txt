Good morning, the first part of your Monday will have quiet weather as you head
back to work and school. Clouds will be increasing as the tropical cloud deck
from Ida moves into our area. The daytime will generally be dry today with only
a sporadic shower chance, and highs in the mid to upper 80s with very muggy air
in place.

Then, we'll be transitioning into Storm Alert Weather Day mode this evening and
throughout Tuesday. The remnants of Ida will bring our area heavy rain with the
potential of flooding, an isolated tornado threat, and wind gusts at 20-30mph.

RAIN: Expect 2-4" of rainfall from Monday night through Wednesday morning, most
of which will fall on Tuesday. The heaviest rain from Ida will be west of I-75,
including Chattanooga, and most of our Tennessee Counties are under a Flash
Flood Watch from 8AM Tuesday to 2PM Wednesday. I expect additional counties in
GA and AL will be added today.

SEVERE WEATHER: Ida's pass will be different than Fred two weeks ago when we had
consistent, steady rain. This time, we'll be on the east or "dirty" side of the
system, so we'll experience a combination of steady rain and broken waves of
storms. A few storms may become strong to severe with damaging wind gusts and an
isolated quick spin-up tornadoes. Tropical system tornadoes are typically
weaker, but happen very quickly. Please, make sure you have multiple ways to
receive weather notifications starting tonight through Tuesday night.
