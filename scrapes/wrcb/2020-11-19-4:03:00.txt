Good Thursday. After a really chilly start we will have perfect fall weather
this afternoon with sunshine and a high of 64.

Our warm-up will continue Friday and Saturday with lows in the low 40s and highs
near 70. I expect mostly sunny skies both days.

Sunday will be warm also, but an approaching cold front will bring overcast
skies in for most of Sunday. Still we should manage a high of 69.

The front may bring a few showers to the area Monday morning, but they will
quickly move out, and we will be a bit cooler the temps ranging from 37 in the
morning to only 60 in the afternoon.

All next week will be fairly cloudy with highs through the week in the low to
mid 60s.

A very preliminary look at Thanksgiving is showing mostly cloudy skies with
morning temps in the upper 40s and afternoon highs in the low to mid 60s.
