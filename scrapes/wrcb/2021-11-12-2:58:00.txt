Good Friday! We will be cool and pleasant this evening with temps falling
through the low 50ws into the upper 40s. We will keep cooling to a low of 40
Saturday morning. Outside the city temps will fall into the mid to upper 30s,
and even the low 30s on the Cumberland Plateau. Saturday afternoon will remain
chilly with highs in the upper 40s and low 50s with sunny skies.

Sunday will start even colder with FREEZE WATCHES already in effect. In the city
we will hit 32, and in the outlying areas we can expect low to mid 20s. We will
warm to 57 in the afternoon with some clouds and maybe even a sprinkle or two as
another front slides through.

That front will bring another shot of cold air to the Tennessee Valley on
Monday. We will start the week with sunshine and temps ranging from 33 in the
morning to 57 in the afternoon.

Look for warmer weather to return to the area mid-week.
