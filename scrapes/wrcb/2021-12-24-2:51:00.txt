Merry Christmas Eve! It will be a chilly start to the day with temperatures in
the mid to upper-30s this morning. It will warm nicely into the 60s this
afternoon with cloud cover increasing throughout the day. Wind gusts up to 20
mph will be possible this afternoon as winds pick up from the south.

Temperatures will only fall into the 50s tonight as skies become mostly cloudy.
Santa should have no problem traveling through the Tennessee Valley!

Christmas Day is going to be a warm one. High temperatures will top out near 70
degrees under mostly cloudy skies. A few sprinkles will be possible during the
evening but shouldn't impact any Christmas plans.

Temperatures will remain 15-20 degrees above average through next weekend. Wet
weather will return to the area by the middle of next week.
