Warmer temperatures will be moving into the Tennessee Valley for the next 72
hours. I am expecting more sunshine on Friday with highs in the upper 60's. Just
a few high clouds are expected on Saturday with highs again in the upper 60's.
More clouds will move in on Sunday, but the rain will hold off until late Sunday
night. Highs should be in the upper 60's.

A few morning shows will be possible for Monday with clouds decreasing in the
afternoon. Highs will be cooler and in the low 60's. Just a few clouds are
expected on Tuesday with highs in the mid 60's. The big traveling day is usually
on Wednesday, and we will see quite a bit of rain with highs in the low to mid
60's. We may see up to an inch of rain.

Thanksgiving Day will be pleasant with highs in the low 60's and mostly to
partly cloudy skies. Paul Barys
