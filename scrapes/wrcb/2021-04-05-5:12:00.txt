Good Monday. It's a warm and sunny one today. The average high is 70 degrees. We
will be in the upper 70s and low 80s today through Wednesday. Pollen counts will
be extremely high during that time.

A front will bring in some rain showers Thursday morning. 1/4" to 3/4" of rain
is possible. We will dry out Thursday night, and should be rain-free Friday and
Saturday with highs remaining in the upper 70s.

We may get a few scattered storms late in the day Sunday.
