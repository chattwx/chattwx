Good Wednesday. We are facing wet roads this morning as cold rain showers move
through this morning through the early afternoon. Temps are in the 40s and will
remain there through the day so it really is just a cold rain we will be dealing
with. We will see .25" to .5" of rain. There is a Winter Weather Advisory in
effect for Fannin and Gilmer Counties in north GA until noon as temps will fall
sufficiently through the morning so that we may see some areas of freezing rain
above 2000'. Travel on untreated surfaces could be extra hazardous. Up to 1/10"
of ice could accumulate on surfaces in the advisory area, again, primarily above
2000'.

Thursday and Friday will be cold and dry. Lows will be in the upper 20s and low
30s. Highs will be in the mid to upper 40s.

Saturday we will see some light evening showers with temps ranging from 29 to
50. Sunday will be dry with more mild temps. We start at 39, and climb to 54 in
the afternoon.
