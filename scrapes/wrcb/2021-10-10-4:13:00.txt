It has been another beautiful day across the Tennessee Valley. Skies will remain
mostly sunny this evening with temperatures falling into the 70s as the sunsets.
It will remain mild tonight with lows ranging from 60-64 degrees under mostly
clear skies.

Above-average temperatures will continue Monday through Thursday as highs range
from 79-84 degrees each afternoon. Rain chances will be low through the first
part of the week, but a weak cold front could bring a few showers to the
Tennessee Valley on Tuesday. Otherwise, skies will range from mostly sunny to
partly cloudy each day.

A strong cold front will trek across the area late Friday into Saturday,
sparking scattered showers. Rainfall amounts look to remain light, but a major
blast of fall air will likely move in during the day on Saturday. Highs will
drop back into the lower-70s with overnight lows returning to the upper-40s.
Sweater weather officially returns next weekend!
