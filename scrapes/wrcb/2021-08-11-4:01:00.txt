It's a new day, but the weather is the same. We'll experience high heat and
humidity along with scattered showers/storms. Wednesday morning will have a few
areas of patchy dense fog, mainly along river valleys and in spots that received
heavy rain yesterday. A few showers will be possible in the morning, but the
main activity will once again be in the afternoon. The high heat and humid
conditions act as fuel for summertime storms. Like yesterday and Monday, storms
will be hit and miss, but a few of them may become strong to severe with
40-60mph wind. Damaging wind gusts are the primary threat. Storms will also
produce heavy rain, lightning, and hail. For locations not receiving any rain,
it'll simply be hot. Highs today from 90-94 with heat index values topping out
at 100-102. If you'll be outside this afternoon, prepare for both the heat and
the chance for storms.

This summertime pattern will continue on Thursday and Friday as well with highs
in the low 90s, lows in the low 70s, heat index around 100, and daily PM storms.
By the weekend, rain chances will increase associated with a cold front. Then,
Tuesday of next, we'll be watching if T.S. Fred will bring rain here locally.
