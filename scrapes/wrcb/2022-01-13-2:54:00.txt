Good Thursday. Your evening will be nice, overall, but we may get a few spotty
evening showers with a weak front passing through. Temps will be in the 40s.
Friday looks uneventful with partly cloudy skies and temps running from 32 to
51.

For the weekend we already have our first WINTER STORM WATCH for Cherokee Cty,
NC and eastern Polk County which could get 2"-6" of snow. Saturday we will start
with temps in the mid 30s. We will get a high of 48. The low pressure will drop
into the area late Saturday will bring rain showers in Saturday evening through
Saturday night. Sunday we will start with rain early morning, but as temps drop
through the day that will slowly change to a wintry mix and ultimately snow
showers late Sunday into Sunday night. How much rain versus how much snow is
still up in the air.

Monday (MLK, Jr. Day) will be a cold one with temps in the 20s in the morning.
Areas of ice on untreated surfaces will be likely. The high Monday will only
reach the upper 30s!
