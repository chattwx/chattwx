Good Monday. Our Labor Day has been amazing. We will continue that trend through
the evening with clearing skies and temps falling from the upper to the low 70s
by 10 PM.

Tuesday starts great in the upper 50s and low 60s. As we progress we will be
ahead of a front which means we will become a little more humid and may even see
a few spotty showers or storms. The high will reach about 84.

Wednesday will be warmer and a bit humid with temps ranging from 69 in the
morning to 88 in the afternoon.

The front will pass through by Thursday, and ridiculously nice weather will
settle in. Thursday and Friday morning temps will be in the upper 50s and low
60s. Highs will be in the low 80s. Skies will be clear, and humidity low on both
days.

Over the weekend we will see the heat and humidity return with highs in the mid
to upper 80s. I don't expect any rain over the weekend.
