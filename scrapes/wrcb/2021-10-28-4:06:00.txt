Happy Thursday, everyone! As advertised, it's been a messy, raw day around the
Tennessee Valley. Scattered showers and downpours have been moving through the
area.

We have seen winds gusts up to 40 mph around the Valley, with gusts up to 60 mph
in the highest of elevations. The good news is that the winds should begin to
wane this evening,

followed by some breaks in the showers. Temperatures will remain cool, in the
40s and 50s.

Friday will feature more clouds, scattered showers, and cool temperatures. The
highs will be in the 50s. Saturday will start off with more scattered showers
but should see things taper to

drizzle by late day. Highs once again will be in the 50s.

Things begin to drastically improve Sunday into next week. Sunshine returns, and
high temps will warm into the mid-60s.

Our next front looks to arrive next Thursday, bringing another shot for showers
and possibly even colder temperatures.

Stay warm & dry tonight!
