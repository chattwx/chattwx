Happy Wednesday, everyone! It's been a mostly cloudy and cool day around the
region, but the quiet weather is about to come to an end. This evening, look for
mostly cloudy skies and chilly temperatures. We will drop from the 40s into the
30s. We will bottom out with overnight lows in the upper 20s to lower 30s.

Thursday is a Storm Alert Day! A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for the
entire channel 3 viewing area for our Thursday. A wintry mix of rain, sleet, and
snow will be likely from late morning into the afternoon hours. This will still
be a tricky forecast, as a degree or two difference above our heads will make
the difference on rather you will see snow, sleet, or rain/frz. Rain.

Right now, it looks like areas north of Chattanooga, will stand the best chance
at picking up a few inches of snow. From Chattanooga and southward, it looks
like we could see a little snow or sleet to start, with a mix of rain, sleet,
and maybe snow during the afternoon hours. The precip should end as a burst of
light snow across valley locations Thursday afternoon. Because this will be a
mixed bag of precip, accumulation amounts will depend on exactly what falls.
Currently, we're projecting less than an inch of snow, and potentially a glaze
of ice for valley locations. No doubt we will need to adjust this forecast a bit
through tomorrow morning so stay tuned!

Behind the wintry weather, a bitterly cold airmass quickly follows, leading to
the potential for a flash freeze, meaning black ice on bridges and elevated
roads and surfaces. Temps will drop down into the teens by Friday morning w/
wind chills in the single-digits at times.
