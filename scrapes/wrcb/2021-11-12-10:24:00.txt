T.G.I.F, everyone! After a chilly & foggy morning start, things have improved
nicely this afternoon. Plenty of sunshine & low humidity will help boost temps
into the lower 60s. This will be about 10 degrees cooler than most of this week,
but still somewhat pleasant.

Tonight, mostly clear skies and light winds will allow for temps to drop into
the 30s.

Saturday will feature mostly sunny skies and a chilly, blustery day. Highs will
struggle to get out of the 40s across the area! 

Another shot of cold air arrives Saturday night, forcing all of our temperatures
below freezing. A Freeze Watch has been issued for most of the area, in
anticipation of a widespread freeze.

Sunday will feature increasing clouds, but dry. Highs will warm into the 50s.

Another front arrives Sunday night bringing a few more clouds. Overnight lows
will still be in the 30s. After another widespread freeze likely on Tuesday
morning, we will begin a slow warm up through the rest of the week. 

Our next front arrives on Thursday bringing a chance for showers, and possibly
another cool down.

Have a great rest of your Friday!
