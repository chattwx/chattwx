Welcome to the "cooling month". The average high October 1st is 80. By Halloween
the average high has fallen to 68!

Saturday we will climb to a high of 83 with partly cloudy skies and a slight
chance for a shower or two.

Sunday we will again have a high of 83, but we will also have numerous scattered
showers and maybe a thunderstorm or two. I don't expect any severe weather, but
the rain could be heavy at times.

Each day next week we will have scattered showers and thunderstorms possible at
any point with rain chances ranging from 30% to 40% each day. We will also be
much cooler with highs in the low to mid-70s each day.
