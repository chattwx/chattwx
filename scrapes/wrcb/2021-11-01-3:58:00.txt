Good Monday. November is here and the temps should keep falling! The average
high for November 1st is 68. By the 30th the average high has fallen to only 57. 

This evening will be a cool, nice one with temps falling through the 50s under
clear skies.

Tuesday we will start in the low to mid-40s and climb to a chilly high of 61. We
will see some clouds and MAYBE a stray sprinkle or two.

Wednesday will see an even bigger cool down with temps ranging from 42 in the
morning to 52 in the afternoon. I do think we will have a few light afternoon
showers, ending during the evening.

A front will bring some showers on Thursday morning, but they will be light and
should clear out in the afternoon. Temps Thursday will range from 45 to 50.

Friday through the weekend will bring in lots of blue skies and chilly fall
weather. Lows will be in the mid to upper 30s. Highs will range from the mid to
upper 50s.
