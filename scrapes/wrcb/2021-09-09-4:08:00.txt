It's here! It's finally here. The nice weather we've been talking about all week
long is upon us. The cold front has passed. Clouds are moving to the east and
clearing out this morning, and drier, cooler air is filtering in. Today will be
sunny with a northerly breeze at 10-15mph, gusts at 20-25mph. Highs will be
below normal in the upper 70s to low 80s with low humidity. Tonight will be
clear with lows from 55-60.

The nice early fall weather continues on Friday with highs in the upper 70s to
low 80s under a sunny sky. Saturday will be a bit warmer in the low to mid-80s
with a few clouds. The humidity will remain at comfortable levels. Sunday will
be sunny with highs near 88, and then we're back up to around 90 for Monday of
next week, mostly sunny. Tuesday will be in the upper 80s with a spotty shower
possible and more humid, followed by mid-80s on Wednesday with isolated showers.
