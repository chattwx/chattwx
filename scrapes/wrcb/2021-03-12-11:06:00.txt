Good Friday! We will be spoiled with more outdoor weather today and a toasty
high of 78. Skies will be cloudy throughout the day. A front will drape over the
area this evening and may bring a few light sprinkles this evening into tonight.
Temps tonight will drop into the 50s.

Saturday will be cloudy and cooler with only a slight chance for a sprinkle
throughout the day. The high will reach 69.

Sunday will warm back up to 77, and skies will sport a nice mix of sun and
clouds.

Monday will start a more wet pattern that will see a decent chance for rain
Monday evening through Thursday. Highs each day will be around 70. Lows will be
in the 50s. During that time period 1.5"-3.5 of rain will be possible.

We will cool a bit and dry out next Friday into the weekend. Highs will be in
the low 60s.

Spring forward 1 hour Saturday night!!
