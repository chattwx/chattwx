Sunday will be a Storm Alert Weather Day as we anticipate rain changing over to
snow Sunday afternoon and evening. The transition will likely occur Sunday
morning for the Cumberland Plateau and the eastern mountains. The highest
uncertainty, as usual, is for the valley locations. If the transition from rain
to snow occurs earlier in the day, higher snow totals will be possible for these
areas. However, the most likely scenario will be a brief transition to snow as
the moisture moves out, limiting snow totals for our valley communities.

Current Snowfall Forecast:

Cumberland Plateau: 3-7"+
Eastern mountains: 2-5" with higher amounts for elevations above 4,000 ft 
Valley/North Georgia: Dusting-2" (2" amounts will be very localized) 
NE Alabama: 1-4'

A bulk of the moisture will move out by Sunday night, with just a few lingering
flurries around Monday morning.
