The warm dry weather will continue again for Wednesday. We may see a few more
clouds on Thursday with a small chance for a few afternoon or evening showers.
Highs for both days will be in the low 90's.

By Friday the chances for showers and possibly a few storms will rise. I do not
think the storms will be severe. But there could be some gusty winds out of the
heavier rain cells. Highs should be in the mid to upper 80's.

Dry weather will return for the weekend with cooler highs in the low 80's
Saturday and low to mid 80's Sunday. Monday and Tuesday should be dry, too.
Highs will be seasonable and in the mid 80's.
