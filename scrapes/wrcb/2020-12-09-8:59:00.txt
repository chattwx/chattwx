After a chilly morning low of 28, there will be a big improvement over the next
4 nights. Highs today will be pleasant-upper 50s, about 5 degrees above normal
for December 9th, and lows tonight will be 10 degrees higher-upper 30s.

It will flirt 60s on Thursday and Friday, providing a nice break from the cold,
and a good time to soak up some vitamin D during these short days.

The next chance for rain arrives Saturday. At this time-Sunday is the pick day
of the weekend. Rain looks to arrive again Sunday night, especially over Georgia
and Alabama.

The next surge of cold air arrives Monday. There is a chance for a wintry mix on
Monday, but due to lack of agreement in forecast models, going on the lower end
at this time.
