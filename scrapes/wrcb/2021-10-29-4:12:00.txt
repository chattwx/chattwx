Today will be a cloudy, cool day with on and off showers, so have your raincoat
and umbrella handy. Temperatures will fluctuate very little with most locations
ranging between 52 and 56 throughout Friday. Rain chances will taper off to only
spotty showers for this evening -- good news for Friday Night Football games. I
would still take the raincoat/poncho just in case and prep for it to drop from
the low 50s to upper 40s. Overnight lows will be in the mid to upper 40s.

Showers will continue on Saturday especially in the morning through early
afternoon, and then quickly fade out for the evening. Highs will be near 58.
There will still be a few isolated showers Saturday evening after 8pm along the
Cumberland Plateau and eastern mountains, but most locations will be dry for any
festivities. Then, the nice weather comes just in time for Halloween. Clouds
will slowly decrease on Sunday with highs rebounding to the mid-60s.
Trick-or-treating will be great under a mostly clear sky, falling from the low
60s to upper 50s.

Monday and Tuesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the mid-60s. Then, we have
another cool down coming at the end of the work-week.
