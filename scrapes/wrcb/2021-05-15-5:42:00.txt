You'll have great weather this weekend for your graduation parties, swimming in
the pool, fishing, or working in the yard. Today will be mostly sunny with highs
in the mid-70s to 78 and light wind coming from the south to southwest. Clouds
will increase for the evening with a stray light shower/sprinkle chance from
about 9pm ET Saturday into Sunday morning, primarily affecting areas north of
Chattanooga. Any rain will be very minimal, so certainly keep your outdoor plans
for tonight. Overnight lows will be in the mid-50s.
