Good Monday. It has been a rainy weekend and start to the week. Across much of
the TN Valley we have seen 2.5"-4.5" of rain since Saturday. Some spots on and
just west of the plateau have received 7"-10" during the same time period. Be
very wary of localized flooding along creeks and streams as well as on the
roadways. We will see the rainfall tapering this evening to just a few spotty
showers this evening and through tonight.

Tuesday will be a cloudy day with the high reaching about 80. While we won't
have the same persistent rainfall all day, we will have some sporadic showers
here and there popping up through the day.

Tuesday night into Wednesday morning a cold front will begin working through. It
will bring showers and storms back in through Wednesday morning. Behind the
front we will still see spotty showers through the afternoon with a high of only
73. It will also be windy at times. Wednesday, by the way, marks the beginning
of fall.

Thursday and Friday will be amazing. Lows will be in the low 50s, highs in the
low to mid 70s. Skies will be sunny and the humidity will be really low.

We will keep the nice weather through the weekend with cool mornings and
splendid afternoons both Saturday AND Sunday.
