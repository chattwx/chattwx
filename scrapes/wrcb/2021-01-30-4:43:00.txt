Saturday morning is starting off with frigid temperatures below freezing. The
good news though is the wind is calm. Overall, today will have a mostly cloudy
sky with a few light daytime showers possible, mainly around lunch and early
afternoon. Highs will be seasonable around 50 with wind increasing. Tonight rain
will spread across the region from about 10pm until 10am on Sunday morning.
Rainfall totals will be 0.25-0.75", isolated at 1". During this time, it'll also
become breezy with gusts at 20-30mph. The rest of Sunday will have a few
scattered light showers here and there with mild highs around 60.

Cold air comes rushing back in Sunday night, so Monday expect the chill to be
back. We'll be watching Monday (starting in the morning) to have flurries and
snow showers in the higher elevations. It'll remain in the 30s for most of the
day with highs around 40. Clouds will break and clear on Tuesday with highs in
the low 40s. Wednesday will have lots of sunshine and warmer in the low 50s.
