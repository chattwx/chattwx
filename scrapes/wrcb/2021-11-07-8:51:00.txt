Lows will range from 34-38 degrees tonight under mostly clear skies. A few areas
of patchy frost/fog will be possible Monday morning.

A warming trend will take place Monday through Wednesday as highs top out in the
low-70s each afternoon. Cloud cover will build into the area by the middle of
the week ahead of our next weather maker.

A cold front will approach the region Thursday, bringing widespread cloud cover
back to the Tennessee Valley. Rain showers will develop Thursday evening and
linger into Friday. Rainfall amounts will generally remain under 1 inch.

Much colder air will settle in behind the cold front just in time for the
weekend. Highs will struggle to push out of the upper-40s both Saturday and
Sunday with overnight lows dipping close to the freezing mark during the
overnight hours.
