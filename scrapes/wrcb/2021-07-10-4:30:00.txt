Scattered showers and storms will be around this evening before tapering off
tonight. Lows will range from 68-72 degrees under partly cloudy skies.

Sunday will be a Storm Alert Weather Day as we will be tracking the potential
for isolated strong to severe storms. The main threat will be damaging wind
gusts, heavy rain, and frequent lightning. The best time frame for severe
weather will be between 1-9 PM. Any severe threat will end during the overnight
hours.

A stagnant weather pattern will keep rain chances around each afternoon through
next week. For now, the best chances of widespread rain look to be Monday and
Tuesday. Highs temperatures will range anywhere from 84-90 degrees as overnight
lows dip to around 70 degrees each night.
