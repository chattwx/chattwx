Heading through the overnight, skies still cloudy, and MAYBE a sprinkle or two.
Wednesday will remain mostly cloudy through about noon then we may get enough
clearing to heat us up to about 83. We will be a bit breezy with SE winds at
10-15.

Thursday will see mostly sunny skies with the high ramping up to 86.

The sun sticks around, and the mercury keeps rising Friday as the high reaches
89.

We will finally break through to the low 90s with a high of 91 under partly
cloudy skies Saturday.

Sunday will reach a record-tying 93 degrees, set previously in 1953. The record
high for Monday was also set in 11953 at 94. I am forecasting that we will tie
that one as well. We will come short of the 1953 record high of 95 Tuesday, but
still manage a high of 93. Obviously, May of '53 was a bit of a scorcher as
well.

I don't expect any significant rain in the forecast save maybe a few sprinkles
Monday and Tuesday.
