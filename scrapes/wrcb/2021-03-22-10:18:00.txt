It will be a nice afternoon with highs near 70-72. Clouds will roll in this
evening, with overnight lows in the mid to upper 40s.

It will be dry for the morning commute on Tuesday, with light showers beginning
by 10AM -12PM. Rain showers and a few thunderstorms are possible Tuesday night
through Wednesday morning, but there is not a risk for severe weather. Rainfall
amounts during this period will be light, ranging from 0.30" to 0.40" west of
I-75, to 0.01" to 0.10" east of I-75.

Thursday night bears watching. A storm system will likely bring a threat for
severe weather on Thursday into Thursday night for the south. Mississippi,
Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, and far east Texas will be watching this. While
the ingredients are less favorable for the TN Valley, storms bringing heavy
rainfall looks possible, where 1" to 1.5" looks possible east of I-75, 1.5" to
2" for Hamilton County, including Chattanooga, and 2" to 2.5" is possible west
of I-75, bringing totals for the end of the week around 2" to 3" by Friday.

Local small creeks and streams will rise again by the end of the week due to
this week's two systems. Please watch and monitor forecasts closely for flooded
prone areas later in the week.
