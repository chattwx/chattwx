The heaviest rain is sliding into the Blue Ridge mountains and sunshine will be
the name of the game for the rest of this week and into the weekend. Lows
tonight will drop into the mid-'30s with skies gradually clearing. Thursday will
be sunny, windy, and cold with highs in the mid 50's and northwest winds to 20
along with stronger gusts. Thursday night will see a hard freeze with a low near
30 in the city and 20's elsewhere. Friday will be sunny and cold with highs in
the mid to upper 50's.

This weekend will start off partly sunny with highs in mid 60's after a morning
frost. Easter Sunday will be warmer with mostly sunny skies and highs near 70.

Next week will be dry through Wednesday. Skies should be partly cloudy with
warmer highs in the 70's. Paul Barys
