Heat and humidity will continue to build throughout your Wednesday with highs
topping out in the 85-88 degree range. Mostly sunny skies will make way to cloud
cover later this evening as a cold front approaches the region. An isolated
shower (20%) will be possible, but most of us will remain dry. A major drop in
the humidity will occur overnight as drier air filters in across the Tennessee
Valley. Lows will drop into the mid-60s tonight.

Thursday and Friday will be picture perfect with sunny skies, low humidity, and
highs in the lower 80s. Overnight lows will be fall-like, ranging from the mid
to upper-50s. A gradual warming trend will begin heading into the upcoming
weekend. Highs will return to the upper-80s by Sunday, along with increasing
humidity. Our next chance of rain will likely hold off until the middle of next
week.
