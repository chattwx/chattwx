Saturday is finally here and it is going to be another fantastic day across the
Tennessee Valley. Temperatures will start in the mid to upper-50s this morning
with low humidity. We will climb into the mid-80s this afternoon under sunny
skies.

Sadly, we are going to trade the comfortable weather for summer-like heat by
Sunday. Temperatures will approach the 90-degree mark by the afternoon, along
with increasing humidity. The good news, we will keep plenty of sunshine in the
forecast!

The heat will ramp up Monday and Tuesday as highs range from 88-91 degrees.
Temperatures will generally be 5-7 degrees above average for the first part of
next week. Rain chances will be reintroduced to the forecast Wednesday through
Friday in the form of isolated afternoon showers and storms. However, no
widespread rain is expected over the next 7 days.
