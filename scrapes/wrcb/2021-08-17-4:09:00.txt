Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day as the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred will
pass through our area. Flash Flood Watches are in effect until Wednesday morning
for all our Georgia counties, Hamilton, Bradley, Polk, McMinn, and Monroe
Counties in TN, and Cherokee Co in NC. The heaviest rainfall will be for areas
east of I-75. These communities have the greatest risk for flash flooding. 

SUMMARY

- TIMING: Light showers will be ongoing during the early morning hours with the
bulk of the rain occurring between 6am and 6pm today. The window with the
heaviest rain bands will be 8am to 5pm.

- AMOUNT: There will be a sharp change from higher rain totals in the east to
lower totals in the west. A generalized breakdown is about 1" in Chattanooga,
1-2" in Cleveland/Dalton (locally up to 3"), about 2" in Murray Co, 2-3"
Polk/Fannin/Gilmer Co, 3" Cherokee (locally up to 4"), versus only about 0.25"
in W Grundy/W Jackson Co.

- OTHER IMPACTS: Wind is not as big of a threat today as the rain, but a few
wind gusts at 20-30mph will be possible which may cause isolated tree damage.
There's also the potential for small mudslides with the saturated ground.

Temperatures will be in the 70s today with generally overcast skies. Clouds will
break and partially clear overnight with lows in the 60s.
