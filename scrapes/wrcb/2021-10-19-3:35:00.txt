Good Tuesday. What a wonderful afternoon it has been! This evening we will see
clouds building in. With mostly cloudy skies tonight it may be challenging to
enjoy the celestial goings-on. First, tonight is the Full Hunter's Moon. It is
also sometimes called the Blood Moon or Sanguine Moon. We will also see the
Orionid meteor shower peaking overnight tonight (specifically 2 am). Hopefully,
the clouds will break enough so all the sky watchers can check out the heavens.

Wednesday will be partly cloudy. The moon will actually still be in its full
phase so you may have a better view Wednesday night. Highs Wednesday will rocket
up to 77.

Thursday another front will approach and give us a few spotty showers on and off
all day, ending at about 8 pm. The high Thursday will reach 73.

Friday should be a nice one with temps ranging from 57 to 70. Great weather for
the football games in the evening.

Saturday and Sunday will remain fairly warm with highs in the mid-70s, lows in
the 50s, and a slight chance for a sprinkle or two both days.
