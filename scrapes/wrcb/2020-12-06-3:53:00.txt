The last bit of your weekend will be in the 40s after the sun sets with a partly
to mostly cloudy sky. There's a small chance for a few isolated light showers or
sprinkles tonight. Overnight lows will be in the mid-30s with a wind shift
coming out of the northwest as colder air will be ushered in on Monday. Daytime
highs on Monday will struggle to reach around 43 with a brisk northwest breeze
and a partly sunny sky. A few flurries will be possible in the northern higher
elevations to the west and east of Chattanooga, but mainly in the highest
mountains of N Cherokee and SE Monroe Counties which could see some light
accumulation only.

Tuesday will be mostly sunny and still cool with highs near 49. Wednesday and
Thursday will be sunny with some high thin clouds with highs in the mid-50s and
around 60, respectively. The work week will end with broken cloud cover and a
high of 62 on Friday. Showers and a cloudier sky will return on Saturday,
followed by a cooler Sunday.
