Sunday evening will have some breaks in the clouds (mostly cloudy overall), and
a wave will bring a few spots of sprinkles through the area. Clouds will
decrease slightly overnight with lows in the mid-30s. Then, clouds on Monday
morning will give way to a mostly sunny sky for the afternoon. Highs will be
warmer in the mid-50s. Tuesday will be sunny in the mid-50s, and Wednesday will
be in the mid-50s again with a mix of sun and clouds.

The latter half of the week from Wednesday night through Friday has lower
forecast confidence. What we know (high confidence) is we'll have precipitation
- rain first - ahead of and along a strong cold front. Once the front passes,
temperatures will drop significantly resulting in a much colder Christmas day -
low 20s in the morning, highs near 35. It'll also be breezy on Thursday and
Friday. What we have low confidence in is the exact timing of the frontal
passage and the possible transition to snow. As of now, it looks to be rain
starting late Wednesday night into Thursday morning at 0.75-1.25". Then, a
chance for light snow in the higher elevations and valley flurries Thursday PM.
We'll continue to update as we get closer to the event.
