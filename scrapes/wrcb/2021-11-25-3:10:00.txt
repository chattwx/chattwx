Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! The weather has been decent for the big day.
Clouds have rolled in this afternoon, and rain showers will be moving through
during the evening hours. The good news is that the rain will be light, and
should be out of here by midnight. After Midnight, the cold, blustery conditions
roll into the Tennessee Valley. Overnight lows will drop into the lower 30s,
with gusty northwest winds.

Our Black Friday shopping weather will feature plenty of sunshine, but breezy &
cold conditions. Morning temperatures will be around freezing, with daytime
highs only warming into the mid to upper 40s! Feels-like temps will likely hold
into the 30s for most of the day.

The weekend will feature a mix of clouds and sunshine, with morning temps in the
30s and daytime highs in the mid 50s.

A dry front moves through Sunday night into Monday morning, that will reinforce
the below normal temps into most of next week. Highs will be in the 50s and lows
in the 30s. The chilly temperatures will be accompanied by plenty of dry weather
and sunshine!

Have a great evening!
