Good Friday! What a great day it has been (even with the clouds). We will clear
out overnight as some cooler air slides in. By Saturday morning we will be in
the mid to upper 40s (50 in Chattanooga). 

We will kick off May Saturday with the high reaching 79 under sunny skies.

Sunday clouds will build through the day with a slight chance for a passing
shower by Sunday evening. Temps Sunday will range from 55 in the morning to 80
in the afternoon.

Monday we will have scattered hit and miss showers through the day with a few
rumbles of thunder as well. After 6pm we will clear out for the evening. Monday
will have a high of 81.

Tuesday we will see afternoon showers and thunderstorms lasting on and off
through Wednesday morning. Highs will be in the upper 70s both days.

Cooler, dry weather will return by Thursday and Friday with lows in the low 50s
and highs in the low 70s.
