Good Thursday. We are starting with some clouds this morning, and I can't rule
out literally a drop or two of rain on the windshield during the commute, but it
won't be anything significant. Skies will rapidly clear later this morning with
sunny, breezy weather this afternoon. Highs will be around the mid to upper 60s
and winds will blow from the NW at 10-15 mph.

Friday will be cool and cloudy with temps ranging from 45 to 68.

Saturday will bring a few rain showers to the area during the late morning and
afternoon hours. I expect about 1/4" to 1/3" of rain during the day. Highs will
be even cooler in the low 60s. Saturday evening and Saturday night will remain
mostly cloudy, but should be rain free.

Sunday will be overcast with a slight chance for a sprinkle (10%). The high will
reach 70.

Next week will be perfect spring weather with lows in the 40s, highs in the low
70s, and no rain until maybe a few showers on Friday.
