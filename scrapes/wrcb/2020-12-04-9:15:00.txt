Plan for a slow-go most of this afternoon. Here are the rain end times today:

2PM-4PM: Monteagle, Altamont, Scottsboro

3PM-4PM: Chattanooga, Trenton, Dalton

5PM-6PM: Ocoee, Ellijay, Etowah

6PM-7PM: Murphy

Rain accumulation total today will range from 0.50" from I-75 and west, to up to
0.80"-1" near McMinn, Monroe, Polk, Fannin, and Cherokee counties.

As colder temperatures return tonight, there will be flurries, and perhaps some
sleet, for the high elevations in Monroe and Cherokee counties. No winter
accumulation is expected there tonight, though. Timing: 12AM-6AM.

The weekend is cool and dry before another low drops down Monday, bringing a
rain/snow mix as early as Monday morning. As Monday gets closer, please keep
updated and watch every forecast for changing conditions.

TODAY:

12PM: Rain, 48

3PM: Rain ending in Chattanooga, 52

6PM: Rain ending near Murphy, 50
