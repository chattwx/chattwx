After a busy past 2 days in weather, we all get to breathe and enjoy now. Clouds
will slowly clear this evening, lingering the longest over our southern counties
in Georgia and Alabama. Tonight is March's full Worm Moon. It rises at 8:06pm ET
and sets at 8:18am Monday morning. Later tonight will be mostly clear for a
great view of the Moon. Lows will be in the mid to upper 30s.

Monday will be beautiful -- sunny skies, only a few stray clouds, and highs near
65. Wind will be light from the northeast. Tuesday will be sunny in the morning
and partly sunny in the afternoon with highs in the low 70s. Then, our next rain
chances will start Tuesday night with isolated showers. Wednesday will be rainy,
especially in the morning. Highs from 60-64. Thursday will be cooler as we begin
the month of April. Highs in the low 50s with a mostly sunny sky. Friday morning
will be cold with temperatures at or below freezing, so pull out those coats
again. Friday will be sunny with highs in the mid-50s. Saturday will warm
slightly to 65, and then, about 70 for Sunday.
