Happy Tuesday, everyone!

We're looking at partly cloudy skies and chilly temps again tonight. Overnight
lows will dip down into the 40s.

Wednesday will feature a mixture of clouds and some sunshine. Morning temps will
be in the 40s, with afternoon highs in the mid to upper 60s.

Clouds will be on the increase Wednesday night, ahead of our next significant
weather maker. A potent storm system moves our way Thursday bringing more
widespread showers & even a few rumbles. Right now, the greatest severe weather
threat with this system looks to set up along & south of the I-20 border, but
heavy rain and gusty winds will be possible here in the Tennessee Valley. This
system will basically get stuck over the area heading into the weekend, leading
to scattered periods of clouds and showers. Temperatures will also be WELL below
normal, with daytime highs some 10-15 degrees below where they should be.

The good news is that the entire pattern clears just in time for Halloween,
leading to plenty of sunshine during the day, and clear skies during the
evening. Highs will be in the 60s, but evening temps will be falling through the
50s into the 40s.

Have a great evening!
