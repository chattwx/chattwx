Good Thursday. Western wildfires continue to pump smoke eastward including here
in the Tennessee Valley. A hazy hue has been a dominant feature of our weather
today, and it looks as though it will hang around at least through tomorrow. The
biggest threat will be to people with preexisting breathing conditions. You may
want to limit your time outdoors through Friday.

Otherwise, the heat and humidity are the stars of the show. This evening will
not be too bad with modest humidity and temps falling through the 80s.

Friday will again be hot, humid, and hazy. Highs will reach the low 90s with the
heat index soaring to the mid-90s. We will have a full "buck" moon Friday night.

We may have a shower or two over the weekend, but the main feature will continue
to be the hot mugginess. Highs will reach 93 Saturday and 92 Sunday.

Rain chances increase a little Monday and Tuesday, but we will still be muggy
with highs around 90.

We will crank the heat up another level the second half of next week. Highs will
make it to the mid-90s, and heat index values will climb to about 100 degrees.
