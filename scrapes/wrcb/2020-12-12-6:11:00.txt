Before you head out this afternoon or evening, the safest plan is to take your
raincoat with you. The light showers we've been experiencing will slowly clear
out from west to east. Roughly finishing up in Chattanooga around 7pm, Cleveland
8pm, Dalton 9pm, Cherokee County in NC not until about 11pm. It'll be in the 50s
this evening, and then clouds will partially clear tonight with lows from 38-45,
coolest the farther west.

Sunday will be the better day of the weekend for outdoor plans. It'll have a mix
of sun and clouds during the daytime with highs near 60. Then, for Sunday night,
clouds and widespread heavier rain will arrive and last into Monday morning. The
heaviest rain will be from about midnight to 5am Monday. As colder air wraps
around, a little wintry mix in the higher elevations will be possible. Highs on
Monday will be cooler in the 40s with a dry afternoon and clouds breaking
slightly. Tuesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 50s. Wednesday will
have showers again and cool staying in the 40s. We'll watch once again for a
little wintry mix in the higher elevations. Thursday looks mostly sunny with
highs only in the mid-40s. Friday will have lots of sunshine and highs in the
upper 40s.
