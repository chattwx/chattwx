You can see the Strawberry Full Moon through 7:06AM this morning. Those along
the Cumberland Plateau won't have the best opportunity due to clouds, but those
in the lower elevations like Chattanooga, Cleveland, and Dalton will have good
viewing this morning.

Today will be a great day to head to the water. Enjoy the partly cloudy sky,
south winds, and warming afternoon as temperatures top the upper 80s.

The weekend will bring very limited rain. I'm only seeing a trace to 0.10" of
rainfall through Sunday night. Enjoy!

I'm also seeing very little rainfall to begin the next work week. Temperatures
may still flirt with the 90s for most of next week now, heading into July.

TODAY:

6AM: P. Cloudy, 70

12PM: P. Cloudy, 81

3PM: P. Cloudy, 88
