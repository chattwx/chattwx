Another day of sunshine is in store for the Tennessee Valley. Temperatures will
continue warming into the mid to upper 80s through the afternoon hours.
Fortunately, the humidity will be tolerable making for a comfortable June day.
Skies will remain clear tonight as temperatures fall back into the lower 60s.

Friday will likely be our warmest day of the week with temperatures ranging from
90-94 degrees under a mostly sunny sky. Clouds will be on the increase Saturday
with a few showers late in the day.

We are monitoring the tropics closely for your Father's Day festivities. An
unorganized area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico now has a 90% of becoming
a tropical system in the next 48 hours. The exact timing and track of the system
are hard to pinpoint at this time. Portions of the Tennessee Valley could
receive heavy rainfall if the system tracks close enough to our area. For now,
it looks like Georgia and Alabama will have the highest impacts. As the system
becomes more organized we will have a better idea of what to expect.

Unsettled weather will continue into Monday and Tuesday as a cold front
approaches the area. Periods of heavy rain and storms will be likely area-wide.
Conditions will improve by the middle of the week with a nice summertime cool
down heading our way.
