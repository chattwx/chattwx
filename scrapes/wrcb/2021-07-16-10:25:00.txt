We will see a few more showers drifting northeast mainly through north GA into
the Blue Ridge. These may last into the overnight.

Saturday we will start with maybe one or two morning showers, but the day will
start fairly quiet. After noon we will have a number of areas of heavy rain and
thunderstorms to deal with. Also be aware of lightning, gusty winds, and
possibly small hail with some of the stronger storms that develop. Some could
get more than an inch of rain. The storms should quiet after about 8 or 9 PM.

Sunday morning the passing of a front will bring a few remnant showers and maybe
a rumble of thunder. The afternoon may see a lingering shower or storm, but the
best chance for rain will be in the morning.

Monday we will also have a few showers and storms with highs remaining in the
mid-80s.

The rest of next week will be hot and humid with highs returning to the 90s and
only the slightest chance for an afternoon storm each day.
