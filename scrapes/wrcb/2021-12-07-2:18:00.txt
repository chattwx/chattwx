Good Tuesday. Clouds will be on the increase this evening, and we may even get a
few light showers late tonight mainly south and east of Chattanooga. Temps this
evening will remain cool in the low to mid-40s. The cloud cover won't allow much
overnight cooling, though as our Wednesday morning low will drop to 41 in
Chattanooga.

Wednesday we will clear out, and it should be a great day with afternoon
sunshine and a high of 58. Thursday we will start cold in the low 30s but warm
to 61 with clouds in the afternoon.

Friday we will see a few on and off showers through the day ahead of a
slow-moving front. Still, SW winds will be able to hoist us up to a high of 68.

Saturday we will see a line of thunderstorms as the front moves through. The
timing of the storms will be 8am to 1pm. Right now the threat of severe weather
is low, but we will keep a close eye on it as Saturday approaches. 1" to 2" of
rain through Saturday is certainly possible.

The colder air moves in Sunday with sunshine and temps ranging from 33 in the
morning to 52 in the afternoon.
