Good morning, please be careful driving on untreated mountain roads this
morning. Partially melted slush and compacted snow may have refrozen during the
overnight hours. Most valley roads should be fine this morning with only
isolated slick spots. We will have some sunshine today, which will dramatically
help improve the road conditions in the higher elevations as the day progresses.
Overall, Tuesday will be mostly sunny and warmer than yesterday, but it'll still
be a cool day with highs in the mid-40s - 48 in Chattanooga. Tonight will be
partly cloudy with lows around freezing in the 30s.

Wednesday will be mostly cloudy and the warmest day of the week with highs in
the low 50s. Most of the daytime will be dry with only a stray afternoon shower.
Then, widespread rain will push across the area with a cold front Wednesday
night into Thursday morning. There is a chance for wintry mix, including light
freezing rain, Thursday morning. The biggest concern will be for the higher
elevations. Thursday's official high will be at midnight, and then a secondary
daytime high will be near 38. The cold air will continue on Friday with a slight
chance for snow showers.
