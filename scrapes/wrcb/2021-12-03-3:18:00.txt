Happy Friday! Today will be another warm and sunny day with high temperatures
closer to the record than normal. We'll begin the day cool in the 40s, warming
up quickly to the mid-60s by noon, and then afternoon highs in the low 70s.
Clouds will increase this evening, becoming partly cloudy with temperatures
dropping from the low 60s into the 50s. Still comfortable for December Friday
night plans outside. Overnight lows will be from about 45-50.

Expect more clouds during the weekend. It'll still be mild in the mid-60s with
mostly cloudy skies on Saturday and Sunday. The weekend will mainly be dry, but
there is a 10% chance for a spotty shower on Saturday and 20% on Sunday. More
widespread rain will arrive Monday morning, and it's needed across the area.
We'll have one last push of mild air with highs around 60, but once the cold
front passes, colder air will move in. Lows Tuesday morning will be back down
near freezing and highs only in the low 50s. We'll have more rain on Wednesday,
which looks to be a bigger soaking rain event, followed by a few additional
showers on Thursday. For the latest, download the WRCB weather app.
