The big weather story for today will be the heat. Highs today will be in the
upper 80s to low 90s, and the humidity will have it feeling like the mid-90s.
We'll have a mostly sunny sky and only a small isolated shower chance, generally
between noon and 8pm ET. Tonight will be mostly clear with lows from 65-70.

Friday will begin sunny, becoming partly cloudy for the afternoon. It'll still
be hot in the upper 80s to low 90s with scattered showers/storms. Then, Saturday
will begin quietly, but a cold front will approach our area later in the day
with showers and storms firing up. The front will stall out producing likely
rain and storm chances on both Sunday and Monday, too. Locally heavy rainfall
may cause flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas all 3 days, and we'll
need to keep an eye on Saturday PM for damaging wind gusts in stronger storms.
