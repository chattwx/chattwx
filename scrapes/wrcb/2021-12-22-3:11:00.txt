Good Wednesday. Cold air is spilling in tonight. We will drop through the 30s
this evening, and make it down to the upper 20s by Thursday morning under clear
skies.

Despite the cold start, it will be a really nice day Thursday with sunny skies
in the afternoon and a mild high of 57.

The warm-up continues into Christmas Eve with temps ranging from 36 in the
morning to 63 in the afternoon.

Saturday promises to be a warm Christmas. We start with morning temps in the
mid-50s and rocket to 70 for the afternoon high. Skies will be cloudy, and we
may get an evening sprinkle or two Saturday.

Sunday looks great as well with the high making it to 71.

Next week will stay warm with little in the way of rain until mid-week.
