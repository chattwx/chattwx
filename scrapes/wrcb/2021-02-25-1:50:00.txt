We are going to see big changes to this weather pattern for the next week or so.
Showers will move in before dawn from the west to the east. With a mild low in
the upper 40's, tonight, and highs in the mid 50's on Friday. Rain will be
likely for Friday right into Friday night. There may even be a few
thunderstorms. Over an inch of rain will be possible.

On Saturday we should have a good chance for scattered showers with a warm high
in the low 70's. Sunday will see a better chance for showers with a high again
in the low 70's.

Monday will be wet early in the day with a cooler high in the low to mid 60's.
Tuesday will start off dry with showers returning into the afternoon and
evening. Wednesday will see the rain showers moving off to the east. There could
be a few lingering showers next Thursday morning, but we should see clearing by
afternoon. Paul Barys
