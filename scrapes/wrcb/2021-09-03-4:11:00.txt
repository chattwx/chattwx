Good morning! We have a mixture of 50s and 60s this Friday morning, so if you're
outside of the Chattanooga metro, you may want to grab a light jacket before you
head out the door prior to 8am or so. The rest of the day, it'll be really
comfortable, hitting the mid to upper 70s at noon and highs in the low to
mid-80s today. We will have more clouds today compared to yesterday for a
sun/cloud mix. It'll be in the 70s for Friday Night Football games, perfect
weather! Overnight will be partly cloudy with lows in the low 60s.

Kicking off Labor Day weekend, Saturday will be a beautiful day with a mostly
sunny sky and highs in the mid-80s with low humidity. Sunday will be partly
sunny - dry for the first part of the day, and then scattered showers/storms
will develop for late afternoon into the evening. Highs in the mid-80s. The
showers will continue into Monday morning, then the rest of Labor Day should be
nice with clouds clearing out and highs near 85. Enjoy!
