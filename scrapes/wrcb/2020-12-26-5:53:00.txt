Good Saturday night. We made it up to 45 today after hitting 19 in Chattanooga
this morning. Overnight we will drop into the low to mid 20s to start our
Sunday. Sunday afternoon will be great with mostly sunny skies and a high of 56!

Another front will move through Sunday night and Monday morning, but it will
only bring a stray sprinkle Monday morning. We will get less than 1/10". The
afternoon will be cloudy with highs in the mid-50s.

Tuesday and Wednesday will be a bit more mild with lows in the 30s and highs in
the low 50s.

Thursday another front will bring in rain all day for New Year's Eve. We will
amass 1"-2" with locally higher amounts through the day. Temps will be in the
low to mid-50s all day. The showers could linger into Friday morning, but temps
will still be in the 40s and low 50s so it should only be a rain event.

Friday, New Years Day, will be colder with partly cloudy skies and temps ranging
from 35 in the morning to 46 in the afternoon.
