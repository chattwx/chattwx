A Storm Alert Weather Day will be in effect Monday as widespread rain and
thunderstorms arrive between 6 AM and 1 PM. A few isolated strong storms will be
possible along the cold front, but it is a low-end chance. Conditions will
improve by the afternoon hours with temperatures dropping into the 50s as the
front passes. Skies will clear Monday night, and temperatures will fall into the
lower-30s.

Tuesday will be much colder with highs topping out in the upper-40s under partly
cloudy skies. A few showers will be possible Wednesday morning, but both
Wednesday and Thursday will be mainly dry.

Our next chance of rain will be late Friday into the weekend as a low-pressure
system approaches the region. Up to an inch of rain will be possible through
Sunday morning. Temperatures will once again turn warmer heading into the
weekend.
