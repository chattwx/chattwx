Happy Fourth of July! Cool temperatures this morning will make way to highs in
the mid to upper 80s under sunny skies. Humidity levels will remain low as dry
air continues to filter in from the north. Temperatures will range from 77-82
degrees this evening as you head out to local firework displays.

 

The heat and humidity return Monday and Tuesday. Temperatures will top out in
the low to mid-90s with minimal rain chances. The pattern begins to shift by the
middle of the week as more moisture pushes back into the Tennessee Valley.
Scattered afternoon showers and storms will be the norm Wednesday through this
upcoming weekend.

Tropical Storm Elsa will bring heavy rain and wind to Cuba and Jamaica this
evening. Elsa will continue to the north and impact the Florida Peninsula
beginning Monday morning. For now, it does not look like Tropical Storm Elsa
will pose much of a threat to the Tennessee Valley.
