Small, spotty showers are popping up just to the south of us around Rome, GA
this Saturday afternoon. They'll slowly shift northward and break up. Most
locations will stay dry, but if you're heading out for Saturday evening plans,
maybe include a raincoat just in case. A few will be possible around 6pm,
increasing after 9pm. The start of Riverfront Nights at 7:00 should be dry.

Scattered showers will increase overnight with lows in the mid to upper 60s.
Then, Sunday will have on and off periods of scattered showers and storms with a
mostly cloudy sky. It won't be rainy all day long for any given location, but if
a storm does develop over your area, you could get a quick burst of heavy rain.
Highs will be cooler around 80.

The summertime pattern of hit and miss storms will last all work-week.
Showers/storms will be likely on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Highs in the
low 80s on Monday and mid-80s on Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday will have more
sunshine breaking through for a partly cloudy day and highs in the upper 80s,
30% chance for showers. Friday will have scattered showers and storms again,
including activity in the morning.
