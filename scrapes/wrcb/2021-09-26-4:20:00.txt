Happy Sunday! Areas of patchy fog will be around before 9 AM across the
Tennessee Valley, especially in the higher elevations. The rest of the day will
feature plenty of sunshine with just a few passing clouds. High temperatures
will range from 76-80 degrees. Overall, great weather for the Ironman
competition!

Above-average temperatures and increasing humidity will return to the area
Monday through Friday. Highs will range from 80-85 degrees each afternoon with
overnight lows falling to around 60 degrees during the night. Skies will
generally remain sunny each afternoon with cloud cover increasing towards the
end of the week. No rain is in the forecast for the next 6-7 days.

In the tropics, Hurricane Sam continues to strengthen and now has 145 mph
sustained winds. It is unlikely that Sam will have any direct impacts on the
United States.
