Good Friday! This evening may see one or two showers, but it will overall be
quiet and mostly cloudy with temps in the mid-70s.

I would start planning indoor alternatives for this weekend. We can expect
scattered showers and a few thunderstorms on and off all day Saturday tapering a
little Saturday evening. Sunday we will be another rainy one all day. Highs over
the weekend will be in the upper 70s. rainfall amounts will range from .5" to 1"
with isolated areas getting 2+".

Next week will start the same. Scattered showers and storms are likely both
Monday and Tuesday with highs staying around 80.

A cold front will move in just in time for the first day of fall Wednesday. We
will get some rain in the morning from that front, but most of Wednesday will be
breezy with clearing skies and plunging humidity. Highs Wednesday will be in the
low to mid-70s.

Thursday and Friday will be flawless with sunshine, low humidity, and temps
ranging from the mid-50s in the morning to the mid-70s in the afternoon.
