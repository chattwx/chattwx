Good morning, today will not start as cold as the past few days, so you don't
have to worry about bundling up as much. However, afternoon highs will be cooler
than yesterday in the upper 40s to low 50s thanks to a cold front passing our
area. Mostly cloudy to cloudy skies in the morning will partially clear out for
sunshine for Tuesday afternoon. Tonight will be mostly clear and colder again
with lows in the mid-20s.

Wednesday will have lots of blue sky and sunshine with a few passing high clouds
and reaching the low 40s. The quiet weather will continue on Thursday with highs
in the upper 40s to 50 and mostly sunny. Another shot of cold air will come on
Friday. Expect mostly cloudy skies, highs only in the low 40s, and as the cold
front passes, isolated light snow showers will be possible â€“ mainly along the
higher elevations.

Saturday will be frigid with morning temperatures in the upper teens to low 20s
and highs only near 38. Thankfully, we will have sunshine. After another very
cold start on Sunday morning, temperatures will rebound to 48 and mostly sunny.
