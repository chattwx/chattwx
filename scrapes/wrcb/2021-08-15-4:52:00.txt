Happy Sunday! Quiet conditions are expected this morning under partly cloudy
skies. Another round of scattered showers and storms will develop this afternoon
and continue into the evening hours. Temperatures will be a few degrees cooler
than yesterday as highs will range from 86-90 degrees.

Monday will feature a very similar weather pattern with showers and storms
developing during the afternoon hours. Highs will top out in the mid-80s.

Tuesday and Wednesday will likely be our wettest days of the upcoming week as
the remnants of Fred track into the Tennessee Valley. Periods of rain and
thunderstorms will lead to some flash flooding concerns, especially in our
eastern communities. 1-3" of rainfall is expected with locally higher amounts.
