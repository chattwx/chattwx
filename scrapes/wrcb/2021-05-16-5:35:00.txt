Sunday morning begins with a few showers for locations north of Chattanooga,
primarily Bledsoe, Rhea, Meigs, and McMinn Counties until about 10am. Then, the
rest of the day should remain dry except for a sporadic sprinkle, so enjoy your
outdoor plans. There will be varying amounts of clouds with NW Georgia and NE
Alabama communities having less clouds than Tennessee and Cherokee Co in NC.
I'll call it a mix of sun and clouds overall with warm highs in the upper 70s to
around 80.

Tonight will be partly cloudy with lows in the mid-50s. Monday will be partly
sunny with highs near 82. Tuesday will be mostly cloudy with a few isolated
showers/storms (20%) and highs in the upper 70s to 80. Wednesday will be partly
sunny and 83. Then, the warm up really starts going. Thursday will have more sun
than clouds with a high of 84. It'll reach the mid-80s on Friday with a mostly
sunny sky. Saturday in the upper 80s, and then Sunday looks to be the first 90
of the year!
