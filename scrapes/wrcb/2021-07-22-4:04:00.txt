Thursday will begin with areas of river fog, lasting until about 9am. You may
also notice even before the sun rises that it's hazy outside. The Moon has an
orange glow to it, and we should be in for a reddish sunrise and sunset today.
The haze and subsequent colors are due to western and Canadian wildfire smoke
moving into our area. Most of the smoke is aloft, producing the haze, but some
will make it to ground level reducing air quality. Cherokee County in NC is
under a Code Orange Air Quality Alert through tonight, which means particulate
matter levels are unhealthy for sensitive people. Active children and adults,
and people with a respiratory disease such as asthma, should limit prolonged
outdoor exertion. The rest of the area will be dealing with Moderate air quality
today which is generally acceptable for the population.

Now to the weather forecast, today, Friday, and Saturday will have mainly sunny
skies, highs in the low 90s, and very limited if any rainfall chances (spotty at
best). Heat index in the mid-90s. Sunday will be partly cloudy with an isolated
shower and highs in the low 90s. It will be very humid, and it now looks like
the heat index will stay just below the triple digits in the upper 90s.
