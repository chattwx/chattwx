Good Tuesday. This evening will feature partly cloudy skies and cool temps
dropping from the low 40s into the upper 30s.

Wednesday will be mild and cloudy with temps ranging from 35 in the morning to
56 in the afternoon. I do expect a front to bring in the rain Wednesday night
through early Thursday morning.

Thursday temps will start in the mid-30s in the valley, but on the Cumberland
Plateau temps will be in the upper 20s. We may see some sleet and freezing rain
on the back of the front, so use caution on the plateau during your morning
commute. It will be cold all day Thursday with temps topping out around 40.

Friday the cold air keeps spilling in. Temps will range from 26 to only 32 for
the high. Saturday will start cold in the mid-20s, but we rebound a little with
a high of 41. A couple of systems passing to our south may bring a few light
snow showers to parts of the area Friday and Saturday. Sunday will be partly
cloudy with a low of 25 and a high of 45.
