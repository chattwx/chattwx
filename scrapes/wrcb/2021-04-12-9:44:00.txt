Today's Air Quality Index is 50, and the Tree Pollen is 2679 (very high) with
biggest allergens of Pine, Poplar, Dogwood, and Pear.

It will be a warm Monday afternoon with highs near 80-82. It will be breezy at
times with a west/northwest wind of 10-15, gusting up to 20 mph.

It will be pleasant again on Tuesday with a few more clouds, and a stray shower
chance north of Chattanooga on Tuesday afternoon. Storms are not expected.

Wednesday will be the next best chance of measurable rain, where 0.30" to 0.90"
is possible. Timing is Wednesday afternoon through evening. Thunderstorms will
be possible.

It will turn cooler by Thursday, with highs in the mid 60s, Thursday through
Saturday. During this time, nights will be in the mid to low 40s. Still not cold
enough for a frost. In fact, climatologically, the last frost occurs on April
11th. While I don't see a frost in the next week or two, in the next 2 to 3
weeks it will be safe to start seeds outdoors for:

Squash, Pumpkins, Cucumbers, Corn, and Beans.
