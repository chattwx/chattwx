It's a very cold start to your weekend with temperatures in the 20s for most, a
few spots in the teens, so bundle up before heading out. The sunshine did us a
lot of favors yesterday, but any locations that still had water or slush on the
ground/roads last night will have re-frozen. Thus, watch for icy patches. By
10AM, road temps should be back above freezing. Today will have a blue sky and
sunshine with highs from 45-50. Tonight, some thin clouds will stream by after
midnight with lows in the mid to upper 20s.

Sunday will be warmer - a great day to enjoy outside. Highs will be in the
mid-50s with a sunny sky. Clouds increase overnight with rain for Monday morning
into early afternoon from west to east. Monday will be in the mid-50s again.
Tuesday and Wednesday are both looking fantastic! Sunny days with highs around
60 and then mid-60s respectively. Thursday will have more clouds and a couple of
isolated showers possible. Then, the timing is still uncertain, but we'll be
watching Friday and Saturday for rain for most and possibly wintry mix for spots
north.
