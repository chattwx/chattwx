The humidity will be high for the rest of this week and as ripples of energy fly
from the southwest to the northeast in the upper atmosphere, showers will pop up
along with a few storms. The best chances for showers and storms will be on
Thursday and Friday. This will occur any time of the day or night.

Highs Wednesday through Friday will be in the low to mid 80's. Saturday and
Sunday will see highs in the upper 80's to near 90. The chances for storms will
lessen just a bit on Saturday. Right now, it looks dry on Sunday. Monday and
Tuesday should have highs near 90 and will be dry.
