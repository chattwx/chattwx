Good Afternoon,

Pollen is back up to 3605 over the last 24 hours (still in the very high
category).

TONIGHT:

An isolated shower/storm is possible, but nothing that looks to be impressive.

Temperatures will stay warm this evening in the 70s through 10PM, too. Lows
overnight will be in the low 60s.

SATURDAY:

Is a Storm Alert Weather Day. Rain and thunderstorms will increase by 10AM-11AM
west, and end in our eastern counties by 2PM-3PM. The Storm Prediction Center
does have us in a Marginal Risk tomorrow for a 2% probability for a tornado
(low). Much like yesterday - perhaps a brief warning or brief spin up. There is
a better chance for damaging wind gusts 5% for Ham Co, but 15% probability for
Alabama counties.

Rainfall amounts for Saturday will range from 1" to 2" west of I-75, perhaps
isolated amounts up to 3" in Jackson and Franklin counties. Areas east of I-75
will get lesser amounts of 0.25" to 0.75" through Saturday afternoon.
