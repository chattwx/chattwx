Friday will have a chilly start, especially if you're outside of Chattanooga.
We'll warm up to around 55 by lunch and then the mid-60s for the afternoon.
It'll be a mostly cloudy day with a few light showers/sprinkles this morning
into the first part of the afternoon. Clouds will break slightly in the
afternoon only to increase again this evening. Overall, a quiet weather day.

Saturday will be a Storm Alert Weather Day. First, we'll have heavy rain in the
morning from about 5 to 9am EDT. There may be some embedded thunderstorms, but
the biggest problem will be the rain - 0.5-1.5" total. There will be a lull
period, and then scattered showers and storms will develop for the afternoon and
evening. These storms may become strong to an isolated severe one. The main
risks will be wind and hail. Highs will be around 68. Additionally, there will
be a strong southeasterly breeze at 5-15mph, gusts 25-35. Wind will be greater
in the higher elevations, especially the eastern mountains.

Sunday will be the calm, nice weather day of the weekend. Clouds will decrease
with highs near 73. The warming will continue with 80 on Monday and a mostly
sunny sky. Then, 84 on Tuesday with a mix of sun and clouds.
