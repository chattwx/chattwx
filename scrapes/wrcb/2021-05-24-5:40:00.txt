Sunday began the first day of the 90Â° stretch we're about to embark. This will
continue through Friday. Record today is 94 from 1953.

While dry today, an isolated shower is possible Tuesday. This will be very
light, and very hit and miss, resulting in a few hundredths of an inch.

The end of the week, Friday, may result in an isolated thunderstorm. Organized
storms however, are not anticipated at this time.

By Memorial Day Weekend, highs look to retreat to the upper 80s.
