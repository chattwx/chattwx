Good morning and happy Friday! Today will have a mix of sun and clouds ranging
from partly to mostly cloudy. High temperatures will be slightly warmer than
yesterday in the mid-80s with high humidity. Heat index values will reach 90-92.
The morning hours will generally be quiet, but scattered showers/storms will
develop for the afternoon and evening. The storms will be hit and miss. If you
have a Friday Night Football game to attend, it's best to bring a towel to wipe
off seats and a raincoat just in case. Hopefully, all the storms will dodge
games, but with lightning, a couple of games may be delayed.

Saturday will be very similar with highs in the mid-80s, scattered storms again,
and a partly sunny sky. Sunday will be the better day of the weekend for
consistent outdoor plans with only a few isolated storms. There will also be
more sunshine, but temperatures will be hotter around 90.

Highs in the low 90s for Monday and Tuesday with very minimal rain chances.
Wednesday will have some showers and still hot around 90.
