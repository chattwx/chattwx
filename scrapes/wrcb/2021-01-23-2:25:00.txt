Sunday will have a mix of sun and clouds in the morning, becoming mostly cloudy
in the afternoon. Highs will be in the upper 40s to low 50s. There's only a
small chance for a stray shower during the daytime, so you can keep outdoor
plans. 

On Sunday evening, scattered showers will develop around 8pm, followed by more
widespread rain after midnight. Rain will be moderate to heavy at times during
the early morning hours of Monday, especially in Tennessee and North Carolina.
The heaviest should be done by about 9am. Then, through the day on Monday, there
will be on and off showers with one more band of rain on Monday night. This
night rain will be the time when a thunderstorm will be most likely. Monday will
be warm in the mid-60s.

Any rain/storms will wrap up before sunrise on Tuesday morning. The rest of the
day will be mostly sunny, reaching the mid-60s again. Wednesday will have highs
in the upper 50s to 60 and scattered showers, which will continue into Thursday
morning, followed by cooler temperatures.
