Happy Saturday! It will be a cold day across the Tennessee Valley as highs range
from 47-52 degrees. A few passing clouds will be around this morning with mostly
sunny skies by the afternoon. Be sure to bundle up if you have any outdoor plans
today!

Our first widespread freeze of the season is expected tonight into Sunday
morning. Temperatures will drop below 32 degrees in the valley with some of the
higher elevations falling into the upper-20s. A Freeze Warning will be in effect
from 3-8 AM Sunday.

Sunday and Monday will remain chilly with highs in the mid-50s and overnight
lows in the 30s.

We will begin to warm up by the middle of next week as highs return to the
mid-60s. Another cold front will arrive on Thursday, bringing our next chance of
showers to the area.
