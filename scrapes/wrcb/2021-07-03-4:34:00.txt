It is going to be the perfect evening to get out and enjoy local firework
displays. Temperatures will range from 70-75 degrees around sunset under clear
skies.

The Fourth of July is tomorrow, and we could not ask for better weather across
the Tennessee Valley. Temperatures will top out in the mid to upper 80s with
sunny skies. Overall, it is going to be a great day to enjoy all of the local
festivities.

Southerly winds will bring heat and humidity back to the region Monday into
Tuesday. Rain chances will return to the forecast by the middle of the week and
persist through next weekend. Higher rain chances will also bring slightly
cooler temperatures to the area towards the end of next week.

We are also tracking Tropical Storm Elsa through the Caribbean. Impacts to the
Florida Peninsula could begin as early as Tuesday morning. For now, it looks
like any impacts will stay east of the Tennessee Valley. Download the WRCB
