Wednesday will be hot and muggy with highs in the upper 80s. We won't see many,
but a few areas of heavy rain will possible mainly between 4pm and 9pm. Thursday
the rain chance will be relegated to a few pop up afternoon showers, but most
won't see any. The high will be a muggy 90 degrees. The heat index will be in
the low to mid 90s both days.

Friday will still sport a high of about 90, but we will have better chances for
scattered storms in the afternoon and evening as a front slowly slides through.

Temps will drop over the weekend into the mid 80s with increased chances for
mainly afternoon showers and storms both Saturday and Sunday.
