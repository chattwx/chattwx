Good Thursday. It is another cold start this morning with temps in the 20s. This
afternoon, however, we will receive quite the warm-up with highs reaching the
mid to upper 50s. Clouds will be increasing throughout the day.

An approaching cold front is responsible for the increasing clouds and warmer
weather. Ahead of the front we will see temps Friday morning in the upper 30s
and low 40s. As the front moves through expect rain showers on and off all day
Friday. I expect us to get .5" to 1" of rain through the day. The rain will
taper off through the evening, ending completely after 10pm. The high Friday
will be in the low 50s.

We will be dry and a little cooler behind the front as we head into the weekend.
Saturday we will start in the upper 30s, and warm into the low 50s. Sunday we
start cooler at about 30 in the morning. We will again climb into the low 50s.

Next week looks dry and cool all week. Lows will be in the upper 20s and low 30s
each morning. The afternoons, however, will warm from 50 on Monday to the upper
50s by Friday.
