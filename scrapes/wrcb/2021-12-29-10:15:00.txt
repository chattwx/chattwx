Happy Wednesday, everyone. It's A Storm Alert Weather Day! We are seeing a lull
in the rain activity around the midday time frame, but more showers & storms
will likely develop to our west and head our way as we move into the late
afternoon and evening hours. This is when we will see our greatest risk for
severe storms. Right now, the main time frame for severe weather looks to be in
the 5pm-11pm period. Damaging winds, large hail, and even tornadoes will be
possible, so make sure you stay weather aware through this evening.

Rain begins to exit the area Thursday morning, leading to gradual clearing and a
decent afternoon on Thursday. Friday will kick off dry, but a warm front lifts
north by Friday evening, leading to a few scattered storms. We will have a
low-end risk for one or two of these to produce isolated severe weather. The
more potent storm system arrives on Saturday afternoon. A line of strong to
severe storms will be likely with damaging winds, and other threats.

Finally, rain, falling temps & blustery conditions will be likely Sunday. We
still even have an outside chance for a few flakes to mix in at the tail end
Sunday evening, but the bigger story will be the cold shock for Monday!

Have a great Wednesday!
