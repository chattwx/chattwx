Today begins the active weather period that we'll have for the rest of the
work-week and into the weekend with daily scattered showers/storms. No single
day will be a washout nor will every location receive rain on a given day, but
it's a good idea to at least have a raincoat handy.

Today will have a mostly cloudy sky with cooler highs in the upper 70s to low
80s. We'll have light showers in the morning with scattered storms in the
afternoon into the evening. The biggest concern will be for locally heavy
rainfall.

Thursday will remain mostly cloudy with slightly lower coverage of scattered
showers and storms. Highs again in the upper 70s and low 80s. Friday will have
similar temperatures with a partly sunny sky and scattered showers/storms again.

The hit and miss storms will continue into the weekend with lower chances at
30%, partly sunny skies, and warmer temperatures near 85. For the latest,
