A Storm Alert Weather Day will continue across the Tennessee Valley this
afternoon and evening. The area remains under a marginal (level 1/5) risk for
severe storms with the primary threat being gusty winds. It would be a good idea
to monitor the radar over the next several hours for additional storm
development. Storm activity will die down quickly this evening as we lose
daytime heating. 

The severe threat will end tonight, but a few showers will be possible during
the overnight hours. Lows will drop to around 70 degrees.

Rain chances will remain high Monday and Tuesday primarily during the afternoon
and evening hours. Highs will range from 82-86 degrees.

Wednesday through Friday will feature a typical summertime pattern with isolated
to scattered storms each afternoon and evening. Daytime highs will be closer to
90 degrees with overnight lows in the 70s.
