It is a chilly start to your Saturday, so bundle up before you head out and plan
to use that ice scraper on your car's windshield. By lunchtime, we'll be in the
40s with afternoon highs in the upper 40s to low 50s. High thin clouds will
increase during the day, followed by lower level clouds this evening. Tonight,
light rain showers will begin around midnight and continue into the morning
hours of Sunday. Lows in the upper 30s to 40. The good news for Sunday is that
most of the rain will be in the early morning hours with larger portions of the
daylight hours dry, but still have that rain coat with you for a few more hit
and miss scattered showers. It'll be cloudy to mostly cloudy with highs from
45-50.

Monday will become mostly sunny and a little warmer with highs in the mid-50s.
Tuesday will be sunny and a high of 54. Wednesday will be mostly sunny and in
the mid-50s. Then, comes Thursday and Friday - Christmas Eve and Christmas -
there's quite a bit of discrepancy at this point on what exactly will happen.
What we do know is that we'll have rain on Thursday and by nighttime into
Christmas it'll be much, much colder. Christmas morning lows will be from 20-25.
What we don't know is whether cold air will arrive in time to see a change over
to some snow on Thursday, so certainly check back in the days ahead for updates.
