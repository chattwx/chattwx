Good Wednesday. After a few light showers last night we are seeing the sun
return today with highs in the low 60s. We will be even warmer Thursday. After a
low in the upper 30s we will climb all the way to 68 in the afternoon.

Friday we will see some clouds on and off through the day and it will be a bit
cooler in the afternoon as the highs gets to 59.

The weekend looks awesome. Saturday will be partly cloudy with temps ranging
from 39 to 58. Sunday we will start colder in the upper 20s near 30. We will
then warm into the mid-50s under sunny skies.

We should stay rain-free through next Wednesday with a front bringing the rain
back next Thursday.
