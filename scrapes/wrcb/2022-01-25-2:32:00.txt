Good Tuesday. It was another day in paradise, but, like all vacations, it is
time to get back to the business of late January. this evening will be a bit
blustery with temps dropping into the 30s and NNE winds at 10-15 mph.

It will stay cold and breezy through the day Wednesday with the temp ranging
from 27 in the morning to 45 in the afternoon. Lots of folks outside Chatt will
start Wednesday in the low to mid-20s.

Thursday will start cold at 26, but rebound to a very pleasant 53. Friday
another front will bring clouds and a VERY slight chance for a stray sprinkle or
flurry late in the day as temps cool from a high of 45.

Behind the front, it will be frigid Saturday as we start in the low 20s and only
make it back into the mid-30s. Sunday will start out at 24, but we should get
back to about 50 in the afternoon. The entire weekend will be a dry one.
