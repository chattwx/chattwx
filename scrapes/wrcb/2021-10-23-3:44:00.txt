What a gorgeous Saturday it has been so far! Temperatures will remain in the
upper 60s this afternoon before falling into the 50s this evening. Overnight
lows will range from 46-51 degrees under mostly clear skies.

A warm front will lift to our north Sunday, allowing temperatures to warm back
into the mid to upper-70s. Cloud cover will increase during the afternoon, but
any rain chances will stay well north of the Tennessee Valley.

Our next chance of rain comes Monday as a cold front approaches from the west.
The current timing of scattered showers will be Monday morning through the early
evening hours. We are also monitoring the risk for a few strong storms during
the afternoon hours. 

Conditions will clear for Tuesday as temperatures turn cooler with highs in the
mid-60s. Quiet conditions will be short-lived as a low-pressure system arrives
Wednesday night. Periods of scattered showers and thunderstorms will be possible
from Wednesday night through Saturday morning. The timing of this system could
change so continue to check back for updates.
