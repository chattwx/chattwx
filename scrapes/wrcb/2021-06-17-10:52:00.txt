We made it a toasty 89 Thursday afternoon. Friday will be even hotter with the
high reaching at least the low 90s. We may briefly touch 95. The humidity will
not be outrageous, but it certainly won't be comfortable during the heat of the
day. Get your outdoor stuff done in the morning or evening. Skies will be mostly
sunny all day.

The tropical system in the gulf continues moving northward. Tropical Storm
Warnings are up for parts of the gulf coast. I don't expect much rain other than
a shower or two Saturday. Sunday we could see more widespread showers as the
system moves through. We will get about 1/4" to 1/2" through the weekend. We
will be humid both Saturday and Sunday with highs in the mid-80s. We will have
periods of windy weather over the weekend also.

Sunday is not only Father's Day but the official beginning of summer! The season
starts at 11:31 eastern.

Monday and Tuesday we will stay a bit breezy. A cold front will move through
bringing fairly widespread rain in Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning or
early afternoon. We may get up to 2" in spots to start the week. Cooler and dry
weather will settle in mid-week.
