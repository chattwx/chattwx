A few showers are possible this evening, and perhaps an isolated thunderstorm.
This would be mainly limited to the far southern TN Valley communities near
Jackson, DeKalb, Chattooga, and Floyd counties.

It will be a sticky July night with temperatures near 90째 at 6PM, and a heat
index of 99째 during this time. There will be a heat index all evening! Those
headed to Nightfall tonight, plan to sweat, and stay hydrated. There will be a
heat index of 93-94째 still at 9PM.

THIS WEEKEND:

Saturday will be hot with a high near 95 and a heat index of 100-101째

Sunday will bring a better rain and thunderstorm chance. The best bet looks to
be in the morning on Sunday. It will be possible for brief organized storms,
however, there is not a risk for severe weather at this time.

80s RETURN:
We'll begin our return to the 80s on Sunday, and this will continue through most
of next week! Finally, a break is on the horizon after this streak of 90s.

TONIGHT:

6PM: Hazy and Hot, 90 (Heat Index, 99)

9PM: Muggy, 86, (Heat Index, 94)

12AM: Muggy, 80, (Heat Index, 84)
