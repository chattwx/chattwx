We may see some light rain showers tonight, but I am not expecting any heavy
rain for our end of the Tennessee Valley. Sunshine should return on Saturday and
Sunday. It will be hot, but the humidity levels will be lower. I am expecting
highs in the low 90's.

Monday through Thursday look dry as of now. Highs on Monday and Tuesday will be
in the low 90's with lots of sunshine. If you listen carefully, you may be able
to hear the grass growing. Wednesday will be a bit cooler with highs in the
upper 80's and Thursday will be partly cloudy with highs in the upper 80's. Next
Friday we may have some scattered showers developing with little change in
temperature. Paul Barys
