Today remains a Storm Alert Weather Day, but thankfully, the threat for any
isolated strong to severe storms with damaging wind gusts is going down. The
great majority of locations will only have scattered showers today with a few
pockets of heavy rainfall and limited lightning if any. We're continuing the
alert day because there is a small chance for a localized storm to strengthen
with brief 40-60mph wind gusts. Where: Northeastern communities, including
Dayton, Decatur, Athens, Benton, and Murphy. Updated Timing: A few scattered
showers will last until about 4-5pm ET in Cherokee Co in NC. Highs today in the
low 70s.

A cold front will pass us around 6-7pm ET this evening with partly cloudy skies.
Overnight lows will be cool in the mid to upper 40s. Tuesday will be cooler with
highs near 65 and decreasing clouds and sunshine. Wednesday will have a layer of
high thin clouds with highs in the upper 60s. Then, we will enter an unsettled
pattern with rain on Thursday and Friday and much cooler highs in the low 60s
and mid-50s, respectively.
