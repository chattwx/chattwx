Today will be cool again with highs only reaching the low 40s with a brisk
northerly breeze. It'll be overcast to mostly cloudy early with clouds only
breaking slightly later in the day. Overnight, clouds will clear out more, and
temps will drop to the low to mid-20s. Sunday will have more sunshine with
scattered clouds and will be a seasonable day with highs in the upper 40s.

Monday will start off quiet first thing in the morning. Then, from about
lunchtime onward, we'll have scattered rain showers, and for our higher
elevations (especially to the northwest of Chattanooga), there will be a chance
for wintry mix and snow. At this point, it's too early to get specific, but it's
a day to watch. Activity will carry into Tuesday morning. Highs on Monday will
be in the low 40s. Tuesday will be partly sunny and a little warmer in the
mid-40s. Wednesday and Thursday should be great days next week with lots of
sunshine and highs in the low 50s and mid-50s respectively. The week will wrap
up with a partly sunny sky and an isolated shower on Friday. Highs near 50.
