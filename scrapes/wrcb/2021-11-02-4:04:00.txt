Good Tuesday. We will have another great fall evening with clear skies and temps
dropping through the low 50s into the 40s. Sunset time tonight is 6:45 eastern.

Wednesday we will start with clouds and temps in the low 40s in the valley, but
in the higher elevations we will see temps falling into the mid to upper 30s.
Patchy areas of frost will be possible in those areas overnight. A FROST
ADVISORY is even in effect for Bledsoe and Grundy Counties on the Cumberland
Plateau tonight. In the afternoon we will warm to the low 50s with a few light
sprinkles on and off.

Wednesday night will be another chilly one. There is a FREEZE WATCH for much of
Middle Tennessee, and that extends into GRUNDY COUNTY overnight Wednesday into
Thursday morning. Right now model data is suggesting we will stay just a bit
above freezing Thursday morning on the plateau, but sensitive plants should
spend another night indoors. In the valley, we will be in the low 40s. We may
even see a few light rain showers Thursday morning, but by the afternoon we will
clear out with a high in the low 50s.

Friday and Saturday we will have sunshine with lows in the upper 30s and highs
around 60. Sunday we start cold again at 37, and the high will climb to 65.
