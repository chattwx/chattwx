Thursday will be muggy through the morning with widespread rain and
thunderstorms in the afternoon into Thursday evening. That will keep our high in
the mid to upper 80s tomorrow. The main threat from the storms will be heavy
rain and lightning.

 

The Friday morning commute will be a mess. We will have rain and storms
continuing as a cool front passes through. The rain will be heavy at times, and
frequent lightning will again be a threat. Widespread Thursday into Friday I
expect 1"-2" of rain. Locally we could see 3+ inches under more vigorous storms.
Late morning into the afternoon we will dry out and notice the temp and the
humidity levels beginning to drop. The high Friday will be in the low 80s.

The 4th of July weekend will be awesome. Skies will be sunny and dry with low
humidity and temps ranging from low 60s in the morning to low 80s both Saturday
afternoon. Sunday will be warmer, but still nice in the mid to upper 80s.

The heat and humidity will return next week with temps in the low 90s. Rain will
return to the forecast by the middle of the week.
