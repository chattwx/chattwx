Once again, you'll need jackets in the morning today with chilly temperatures,
and then, you can shed them in the afternoon with warm highs in the low 70s.
Today will have clear, sunny skies in the morning. For the afternoon, high, thin
clouds will move in from the west for filtered sunshine and increase into the
evening. Overnight lows won't be quite as cold in the low to mid-40s.

Wednesday will have some residual clouds in the morning, clearing out for sunny
conditions for the midday and afternoon. It'll be another warm day with highs
near 73. Thursday will be our active weather day with a few isolated showers
possible during the first part of the day. Then, greater rain chances will
arrive associated with a cold front from about 4pm to midnight at about 0.5-1".
Embedded thunderstorms will be possible, too. Clouds will clear for a mostly
sunny Friday with highs around 60. The colder air will settle in for the weekend
with lows in the 30s and highs only in the 50s.
