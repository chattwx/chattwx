Good morning, it's another day to bundle up if you have to head out early on
Wednesday with temperatures in the 20s. Thankfully, once the sun rises, we'll
have a sunny sky and it'll warm quickly hitting the upper 40s to 50 by noon.
Afternoon highs will be a bit warmer today compared to yesterday in the mid-50s
with a few clouds mixed in. Tonight will be partly cloudy with lows in the low
to mid-30s.

Thanksgiving will be nice in the morning with some sun and dry conditions.
Clouds will increase in the afternoon with scattered showers moving west to east
across the area from about 3pm to 1am associated with a cold front. If you're in
one of our northwestern communities, a few stray showers may start up as early
as 1pm. Rainfall will be light at 0.1-0.25". Highs on Thursday will be mild
around 60, but once the cold front passes, Black Friday will be cooler again
with highs near 49 under a mostly sunny sky.

Saturday and Sunday will both have a mix of sun and cloud with highs in the
mid-50s. For the latest, download the WRCB weather app.
