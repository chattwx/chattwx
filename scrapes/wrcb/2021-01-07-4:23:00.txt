Good Thursday. We are starting out with a cool crisp morning, and temps this
afternoon will only make it to about 50 in Chattanooga. I expect rain showers to
begin this afternoon after 1pm. They will continue on and off changing over into
a wintry mix overnight into Friday morning. 

Temps Friday morning will be in the low to mid 30s. . There are WINTER STORM
WATCHES and WARNINGS for the Blue Ridge Mtns. for this evening through Friday
evening. That area could see 1"-4" of snow. We could also see up to 1/2" on the
plateau. It will really just be cold rain in the valley. Rainfall amounts will
range from 1/2" to 3/4". Some areas of ice could accumulate on some elevated
surfaces like bridges, overpasses, and tree limbs.

We will clear out by Friday afternoon, and the weekend will be cold and dry. We
will see more cold rain showers Monday afternoon.
