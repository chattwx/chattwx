Good Wednesday. We can expect spotty showers on and off today. Otherwise, it
will be cloudy and humid with the high only managing to reach the mid to upper
70s. Spotty showers will be possible through late tonight, then end overnight.
Lows tonight will drop into the mid 60s by Thursday morning.

Thursday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. We will start cloudy and muggy. During
the afternoon we will have scattered thunderstorms developing that could produce
some damaging wind gusts in excess of 60 mph. The chance for storms will be
primarily between 1pm and 6pm.

Friday and Saturday will be just warm and a little muggy with highs in the mid
to upper 80s. Sunday we may get a shower or two with the high reaching 90 in
Chattanooga.

Next week we will be in the mid 80s with a few afternoon showers and storms each
day.
