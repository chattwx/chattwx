Rain showers will be ending later tonight with a mild low in the low to mid
50's. Skies will be clearing on Thanksgiving Day as the high climb into the
upper 60's with light winds. Thursday night will see a few clouds with a cooler
low in the mid 40's. Black Friday will be dry with some high clouds and highs
again in the upper 60's. 

Saturday will be quite pleasant with mostly sunny skies and highs in the mid
60's. On Sunday the clouds will be increasing and showers will start as early as
late afternoon, but most likely during the evening and overnight hours. Some of
that rain could become heavy. Highs Sunday should be in the mid 60's.

On Monday heavy rain in the morning will give way to some snow showers
especially in the higher elevations. Colder air will move in along with a
northwest wind. Highs Monday will be in the mid 50's early and then dropping
into the 40's by afternoon. Flurries will be ending Tuesday morning. Highs
Tuesday will be in the low 40's to near 40. Any snowfall accumulation will be
very light in the higher elevations on grassy areas. Paul Barys
