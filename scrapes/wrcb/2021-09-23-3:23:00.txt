Good Thursday. Our amazing weather will continue through the weekend. This
evening will be clear with temps dropping through the 60s. We will cool
overnight into the mid to upper 40s. In the mountains, we will drop to the low
40s! Friday afternoon will be very nice with sunshine and highs in the low 70s.

The weekend looks good. A dying front will spawn a few clouds Saturday, but no
rain. We will start at about 50 in the morning, and climb to 77 in the
afternoon. Sunday temps will range from 55 in the morning to 79 in the
afternoon. Skies Sunday will return to sunny.

Next week we will see the warming trend continue with highs in the low 780s all
week, and humidity levels creeping up a bit as well. There is no chance of rain
next week at least through Thursdsay.
