The first day of September is here, and it is shaping up to be a gorgeous day!
The remnants of Ida have finally moved out of our area after dumping 2-6" of
rain across the Tennessee Valley. Skies will transition from mostly cloudy to
mostly sunny by this evening as high temperatures top out in the lower-80s. A
cold front will push through the region later this evening, bringing a
noticeable change in the humidity. Low temperatures will fall into the lower-60s
tonight under mostly clear skies.

Thursday through Saturday will feature nearly fall-like weather. High
temperatures will range from 80-86 degrees with overnight lows potentially
dropping into the upper-50s in a few locations. No rain is forecast, and
humidity levels will remain comfortable through the weekend.

Our next rain chance looks to be Sunday as a cold front pushes south across the
Tennessee Valley. Scattered showers and a few storms will break out during the
afternoon and gradually end by Sunday night. Drier weather looks to resume
heading into next week.
