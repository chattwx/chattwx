A Wind Advisory is valid today through 10PM for our Georgia communities. Winds
sustained of 15-25 mph with wind gusts to 35 mph possible.

Due to gusty winds in Hamilton County, outdoor burning is not allowed today.

Tree and Grass Pollen remain high today. We should see the numbers drop a bit by
Thursday.

Then, it turns colder tonight!

A Frost Advisory is valid for the lower elevations, including Bradley and
Hamilton, and a Freeze Warning is valid for the higher elevations. Tonight, it's
a good idea to bring in outdoor potted plants. You can also cover plants with
plastic or mulch.

For these in the Freeze Warning tonight, letting outdoor pipes drip slowly, or
wrapping with a towel to prevent freezing and then bursting is, highly
encouraged tonight.

TODAY:

12PM: Broken Clouds, 50

3PM: P. Cloudy, 55

6PM: Clearing, 48
