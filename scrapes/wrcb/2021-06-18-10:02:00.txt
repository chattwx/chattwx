It's almost the weekend and we are wrapping up the week with some summertime
heat. Temperatures will top out in the lower 90s across the area along with
sunny skies. Temperatures will range from 66-71 tonight with only a few passing
clouds.

Our weekend forecast is going to be dependent on the track of "Potential
Tropical Cyclone Three." If this system strengthens it would become Tropical
Storm Claudette. Chattanooga and our surrounding communities are in the latest
forecast cone. However, this is an east side weighted system which means the
heaviest rainfall will be displaced to the east of the main circulation. For
now, it looks like the highest rainfall totals for our area will be in northern
Georgia and Alabama. If a more westerly track occurs then our Tennessee
communities would be dealing with higher rainfall amounts.

The current weekend forecast has uncertainties, but Saturday looks to be mostly
dry with increasing clouds. A few showers will be possible late in the day,
especially in our Georgia and Alabama communities. Sunday will feature scattered
showers with heavy rain possible into portions of Georgia. Communities to the
north and west of Chattanooga will have limited rainfall for your Father's Day
festivities.
