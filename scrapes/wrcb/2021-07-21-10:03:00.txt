TODAY

Hot temperatures are returning, 90°, heat index 93-94°. Isolated showers south
this evening, only 20% coverage for those near DeKalb, Floyd, Chattooga, Gordon,
perhaps southern Walker, Gilmer, Fannin.

THURSDAY

Trending hotter for the next week. Temperatures up to 92°, heat index reaching
96-98° smaller only 10%.

FRIDAY AND INTO THE WEEKEND

The pattern is trending drier and hotter from Friday and through the weekend and
into next week. Minimal rain chances and heat index values near 100 are expected
this weekend. We are in for a stretch of 90+ highs beginning today that will
take us into ALL of next week. Stay cool and hydrated! After a wet pattern, many
lawns will dry out - which I think at this point, many will be fine with.

For those headed to the Lookouts game tonight, plan on sweating initially, as
the heat index will be near 90° for first pitch.

TODAY:

12PM: Partly Sunny and Warm, 82 (Heat index, 85°)

3PM: Partly Sunny and Hot, 90 (Heat index, 94°)
