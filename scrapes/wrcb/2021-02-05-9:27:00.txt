It will still be a bit breezy through noon, while winds will dwindle this
afternoon.

Here are some impressive wind gusts from last night and this morning:

Chattanooga Airport, 40 mph

Cove Mountain, Sevier County, 83 mph

Happy Valley, Blount County, 54 mph

Expect sunshine with a high near 50 to end the work week.

SATURDAY:

Morning will be dry. Rain will arrive by 4PM-5PM. A changeover to a wintry mix
will be possible quickly. Bringing snow accumulation by Sunday morning. This
will be a wet goopy snow in the higher elevations. Amounts of 1/2" to 1" are
possible for Chattanooga, while the Cumberland Plateau could get 2" to 3, and
east of I-75 in the higher elevations including Polk, Fannin, Gilmer, Cherokee,
and Monroe counties could get 2" to 4", possibly locally higher amounts up to 5"
by Saturday night.

This will melt quickly on the roads, as temperatures Saturday night will stay
above freezing in the Valley. Road temperatures will stay above freezing in
Chattanooga-just making for wet roads. We will need to watch for slick roads in
the higher elevations.

TODAY:

12PM: M. Sunny, 42

3PM: M. Sunny, 50

6PM: M. Clear, 46
