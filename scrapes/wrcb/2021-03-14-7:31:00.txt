We'll have pleasant weather this evening to enjoy the first later sunset of
Daylight Saving Time at 7:48pm EDT. You still have a few more hours of daylight
to be outside in the warm temperatures, dropping back into the 60s this evening.
Overnight will be mostly cloudy with lows in the low 50s and possibly a couple
of sprinkles - that's it.

Monday will have generally quiet weather for the morning through early
afternoon. It'll be cooler with highs in the low to mid-60s. Wind will increase
from the southeast with gusts at 20 to 30 mph. Then, scattered showers and
storms will arrive from the west in the afternoon. They'll weaken and break up
as they move eastward through the evening, but a few strong storms will be
possible for our SW counties. Another wave will come up from the south for the
overnight hours into Tuesday, bringing more consistent rain and embedded
thunderstorms, especially in Alabama and Georgia. Highs on Tuesday in the
mid-60s.

We'll be watching Wednesday for another system of rain and storms. There is
potential for strong to severe storms on Wednesday evening/night. Check back
with us for threat updates over the next couple of days. Go ahead and make sure
you know your severe weather plan. Rain will wrap up on Thursday morning. Friday
will then be a cooler day with highs in the upper 50s while remaining mostly
cloudy.
