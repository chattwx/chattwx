Today will start with rain clipping our southern counties and up into Cherokee
County, NC until about 10am. We'll then have a lull period with some breaks in
the clouds and afternoon highs in the mid-50s. Rain showers will start again
from the west around 2pm and carry into the evening. Total rainfall at about
0.25". Temperatures will drop and a transition to wintry mix/snow showers will
be possible for the higher elevations of the Cumberland Plateau and eastern
mountains from about 5-11pm EST. Road temperatures should stay above freezing
with no widespread issues, but as evening snow is coming down, slick spots may
still happen. Any snow accumulations are expected to be minimal at a dusting to
0.5" on grassy and elevated surfaces, although the highest peaks of the
mountains along the TN/NC line could receive up to 4".

Overnight lows will be cold in the upper 20s to 30, so please, watch for black
ice on Thursday morning along any sheltered roads. Thursday will be a sunny with
only a few clouds and much cooler with highs from 40-45. Friday will be mostly
sunny with high thin clouds and highs in the upper 40s. Saturday will be the
better day of the weekend with a partly sunny sky and highs in the low 50s. Rain
will start Saturday night into Sunday morning. Scattered showers will continue
through Sunday with highs in the mid-50s.
