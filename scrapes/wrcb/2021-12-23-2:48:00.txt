Happy Thursday! It is a frigid start this morning as we are waking up to
temperatures into the 20s area wide. Be sure to bundle up if you are heading out
and about!

Sunny skies will help warm us up into the mid to upper-50s this afternoon,
making for a great day to get some last-minute shopping finished up.

Friday will be mild and breezy with temperatures topping out in the mid-60s.
Cloud cover will increase throughout the day, but we will stay dry for those
Christmas Eve events.

It will be even warmer on Christmas Day as temperatures reach near 70 degrees.
That is about 20 degrees above normal for this time of the year. Skies will
remain mostly cloudy throughout the day with wind gusts up to 20 mph. Rain
chances will be very slim.

Warm temperatures will continue into next week with rain chances increasing by
the middle of the week.
