Happy Sunday! It is a cold start across the Tennessee Valley as we are waking up
to temperatures below freezing. If you are heading out early this morning, you
will want to grab your jacket!

Mostly sunny skies will warm temperatures into the mid to upper-50s by this
afternoon. Another cold night is in store with temperatures ranging from 29-33
degrees. Monday will feature mostly sunny skies and chilly temperatures in the
mid-50s.

A warming trend will begin Tuesday into Wednesday as temperatures push back into
the upper-60s to low-70s. A few clouds will be around, but we will stay dry
through the middle of the week.

Our next weather maker will arrive Thursday morning as a cold front pushes
across the region. A few showers will be around early in the day before tapering
off by the afternoon. Cooler temperatures will settle in behind the front
heading into the weekend.
