Good Monday. Today marks the first day of winter, and we are off to a mild
start. We have some patchy dense fog this morning, but we will clear out and
sunshine and mild temps in the mid to upper 50s this afternoon.

We will stay mild and dry through Wednesday. A cold front moves in Wednesday
night bringing rainfall through the overnight into Thursday morning. There is
still HIGH uncertainty if the rain changes over to snow Thursday morning. Temps
will be falling as the rain moves through, but the big question is how cold will
it get Thursday morning as the moisture moves through. Some model data is
suggesting the rain changes to snow with temps in the low to mid 30s Thursday
morning. Other equally reliable data shows us in the low 40s with just cold rain
Thursday morning. That temperature difference will determine if we have a wet
Thursday morning or a white one. As the front moves through, and temps continue
dropping through the day I do think we will have at least some flurries Thursday
afternoon and evening.

Christmas Day will just be cold and dry. Temps will range from 25 in the morning
to only 37 in the afternoon.

The weekend will sport cold mornings in the 20s with cool afternoons in the
upper 40s. Look for more rain showers Sunday evening.
