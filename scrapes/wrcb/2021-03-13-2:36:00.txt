Since mid-afternoon, clouds have slowly broken, especially to the south. They'll
continue to break for partly sunny to mostly cloudy skies, making for a pleasant
evening. Tonight's sunset is at 6:47pm EST, and tomorrow night's will be at
7:48pm EDT. Remember to set those clocks forward 1 hour.

Sunday will be warmer with highs around 73 in Chattanooga, upper 60s to 70 to
the north, and mid-70s to the south. It'll be mostly cloudy with a few spotty
showers primarily in Tennessee into the Blue Ridge Mountains.

A system from the west will bring more widespread rain with a few thunderstorms
on Monday afternoon and evening, falling apart as it moves eastward. Highs will
be near 64. Tuesday will have scattered showers mainly south of Chattanooga with
highs in the mid-60s. Wednesday will reach near 70 with rain and storms likely.
We'll need to keep an eye on Wednesday evening and night as a few storms may be
strong especially for our western counties. Rain will wrap up on Thursday
morning with highs in the mid-60s. Friday will be cooler only in the mid-50s
with a partly cloudy sky.
