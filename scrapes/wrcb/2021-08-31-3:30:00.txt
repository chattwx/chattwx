Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day as we're under the threat of both flash
flooding and severe storms (wind & tornado). Please, remain weather aware all
day long and have multiple ways to receive weather alerts.

The remnants of Ida will affect our weather throughout Tuesday with periods of
steady soaking rain, slight lulls, and also stronger rain bands with embedded
thunderstorms. The bulk will be done by 9pm tonight.

RAIN: Another 1.5-3" today, a few spots at 4", in addition to the rain received
yesterday. All counties are under a Flash Flood Watch for today into Wednesday.
If you live or travel in low-lying flood prone areas, please use extra caution.
Never drive through flood waters.

SEVERE WEATHER:Isolated to scattered severe storms will be possible today.
Communities in Georgia will be at a slightly increased risk. Threats include
damaging wind at 60mph and quick spin-up tornadoes. Tornadoes associated with
tropical systems tend to be weaker, but they develop very quickly. Thus, if your
location is under a tornado warning, you must act immediately. Know your weather
safety plan.

WIND: Wind gusts at 20-30mph, higher possible on mountains. Strongest wind
during afternoon into evening.

Get through today, and the rest of the week will be much better. Wednesday will
have scattered showers, mainly in the morning. Clouds clearing in the evening.
Thursday will be fantastic - low humidity, sunny, highs in the low 80s. Friday
will be mostly sunny with highs near 85.
