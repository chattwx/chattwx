Well, it's cool, but at least that sunshine is ongoing all day.

Tonight, a Freeze Warning is in effect. This means, potted plants, and sensitive
plants will need to be covered. Again. This is the last night, though. Overnight
low temperatures will stay above freezing Saturday night through all of next
week.

Our quiet, and rain-free pattern continues into Easter Weekend. Easter Sunday
actually looks sublime. Highs near 70-71 with sunshine and light winds.

Next chance for rain comes a week from now, Thursday and into Friday. After a
warming trend next week in the mid 70s, it's likely temperatures will take
another dip by mid April.

TONIGHT:

6PM: 54, Sunny

9PM: 42, Clear

12AM: 39, Clear
