Tuesday will be warm, cloudy and breezy with sporadic light showers popping up
through the day.

Wednesday we will start the day with early morning storms. They will taper off
allowing us to warm to 72. We will see another round of strong storms Wednesday
night into overnight of Thursday morning. Some storms may be severe so we will
need to be weather aware Wednesday. Showers will end Thursday, and we will,
again, have highs in the low 70s.

Friday brings another high of 70 with more rain and storms Friday evening into
Saturday. Saturday will feature showers and storms on and off all day with a
record-tying high of 73.

We will have rain and storms all day Sunday as well with temps cooling through
the day.

Some of these storms over the weekend will possibly be severe as well. Heavy
rain will also be an issue. Through Sunday night we could get 5+" of rain.

As temps continue to fall Sunday night into the 20s, we may actually have a
wintry mix of rain and snow Monday morning before clearing out in the afternoon
with highs Monday only in the 40s.
