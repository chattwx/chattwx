Good Monday. We will have warm, cloudy weather with spotty showers on and off
this afternoon through the evening with highs making it into the low to mid 60s!

We are under a "marginal" risk of severe storms tonight between 10pm and 4am for
parts of NW Georgia, SW Hamilton and South Marion Counties. There is a slight
possibility for damaging winds, and an isolated tornado can't be ruled out in
the risk areas. I wouldn't be surprised if we had some small hail as well. Temps
overnight will be in the mid to upper 50s.

Tuesday afternoon will be warm and cloudy with a slight chance for a passing
shower. Highs will be in the mid 60s.

Wednesday temps will range from 46 in the morning to 60 in the afternoon. Low
pressure moving by to our south will bring rain to parts of northeast Georgia
and the Blue Ridge Mountains early in the morning. In the afternoon we will see
skies clearing.

Thursday and Friday will be colder and dry. Thursday temps will range from 34 to
48. Friday we start at 28 and make it to 53.

We will be dry Saturday with a high of 55. Sunday we reach 57 with rain likely.
