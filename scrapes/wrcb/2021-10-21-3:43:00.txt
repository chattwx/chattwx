Good Thursday. We are still under a Storm Alert Weather Day. After the morning
rain, we have seen a bit of sunshine this afternoon. While that might sound
awesome, it is also allowing us to warm up quite a bit and that is helping to
destabilize the atmosphere. The bottom line is a cold front approaching will
have more ingredients to produce strong thunderstorms as it passes through. Here
is the breakdown.

4pm-6pm a line of storms moves over the plateau.

6pm-8pm the line moves through the TN Valley / NW GA

8pm-11pm it moves through the Blue Ridge Mtns.

The main impacts will be heavy rain and lightning. A few of the storms will
produce damaging wind gusts in excess of 60 mph. Downed tree limbs and power
outages are certainly possible as you settle in for the evening. Rainfall
amounts this evening will range from .25"-.50" with locally higher amounts.

Overnight into Friday we will cool down and dry out with temps climbing into the
mid to upper 60s.

Saturday will be a spectacular fall day with sunshine and cool temps ranging
from 48 to 72.

Sunday will be dry with a few clouds and a warmer high of 79.
