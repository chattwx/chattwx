Localized flash flooding concerns will continue into the evening hours as
periods of heavy rain continue to fall. Some locations across the Tennessee
Valley have already picked up anywhere from 1-6" of rain. The potential for
heavy rain will continue through Sunday evening, which is why we are going with
a Storm Alert Weather Day tomorrow. This is just for localized flash flooding.
There is NO chance of any severe storms for Sunday!

Periods of rain and thunderstorms will continue Monday and Tuesday with high
temperatures remaining around 80 degrees.

A cold front will arrive just in time for the first day of fall Wednesday. Rain
chances will dwindle by the afternoon, and drier air will begin to filter into
the area Wednesday evening. Humidity will take a nosedive overnight as
temperatures turn much cooler. This cold front will set up a spectacular end of
the week with highs in the mid-70s and overnight lows in the lower-50s!
