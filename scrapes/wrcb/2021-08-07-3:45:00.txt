The strongest storms are nearing an end for us locally on Saturday afternoon,
affecting our far south and eastern communities. Pretty much everything will be
wrapped up by about 6pm this evening, which means better weather for Saturday
night out plans. Temperatures will vary widely across the area dependent on if a
location received rain or not. No rain - in the 80s. Rain - in the 70s.
Overnight, the sky will become mostly clear with lows in the mid to upper 60s.

Sunday will have lots of sunshine in the morning, becoming partly cloudy for the
afternoon. It'll be hot and humid with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s with
only a spotty shower chance. A great day to spend outside as the last weekend of
summer before heading back to school next week. Monday should reach the low 90s
with heat index values near 96-97 under a mostly sunny sky. A couple of isolated
showers will be possible during the afternoon. Then, Tuesday through the rest of
the week will be muggy with highs near 90 and scattered showers/storms each day.
