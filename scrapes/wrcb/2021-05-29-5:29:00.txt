We kick off Memorial Day weekend with Saturday feeling more like early April
instead of the end of May. It'll be cool this morning. Between the clouds,
northwesterly breeze, and temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s, you'll want
your jacket. Morning boat rides will have a bit of a chill. It'll only warm up
slightly with highs ranging from 65-70. The mostly cloudy morning will break for
a partly sunny afternoon.

Tonight will be partly cloudy with temperatures dipping even more into the upper
40s and low 50s. Sunday, we'll start to climb back up with highs in the mid-70s
and a sunny afternoon. The wind will continue from the north. Then, Memorial Day
will be the warmest of the holiday weekend with highs in the low 80s and mostly
sunny.

Tuesday will have more clouds in the mid-80s. Wednesday will be mostly cloudy
with an isolated shower chance and in the mid-80s. More widespread times of
showers and storms for Thursday and Friday.
