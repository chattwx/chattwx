A few isolated downpours will be around before 3 AM. Otherwise, skies will
remain partly cloudy tonight with lows ranging from 70-74 degrees.

Another round of scattered showers and storms will develop Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy downpours, gusty winds, and frequent lightning will be possible.
Temperatures will remain hot with highs in the 90s and heat index values in the
upper-90s.

Wednesday through Friday will likely be our hottest stretch of weather so far
this summer. Highs will range from 93-97 degrees each afternoon under sunny
skies. Heat index values will push into the triple digits during the heat of the
day. Be sure to stay hydrated and take frequent breaks from work and exercise to
avoid heat stress!

 

In the tropics, we are still monitoring an area of low pressure off of the east
coast of Florida. There is a 50% that this area of disturbed weather becomes a
tropical depression in the next 2-5 days.
