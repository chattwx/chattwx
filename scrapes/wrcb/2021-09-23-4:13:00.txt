We'll have some clouds this morning, but overall, today will have a clear sky
and abundant sunshine with low humidity. You'll likely want a jacket during the
morning with temperatures in the 50s. It'll hit the low 60s by noon, and then
afternoon highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. A fantastic fall day! Tonight will
be cooler with lows from 45-50 under a clear sky. 

Friday will by sunny with highs in the low 70s. Friday night into Saturday
morning will have lows in the upper 40s to low 50s with passing high clouds -
great bonfire weather. Saturday will hit the mid-70s, and then warmer on Sunday
with highs around 80. Both days with considerable sunshine. Wonderful weather
for the IRONMAN, camping, hiking, and simply enjoying the great outdoors. 

Monday and Tuesday will be sunny again with highs in the low 80s. Then Wednesday
will be mostly sunny with the first return of a rain chance in a week, but it'll
be a very slim one at 10%.
