The mild pattern with afternoon highs in the 60s continues!

It will be a fabulous today with lighter winds from the west/southwest 5-8 mph.
Car washes, playing at the park after school, and exploring the garden are great
ways to enjoy the sunshine and warmth this week.

This will continue into Thursday, however there is a small shower chance during
the day then. Amounts of a trace to 0.10" are possible Thursday.

Starting Friday, the pattern becomes much wetter. Rain increases by Friday
morning, where periods of heavy rain will be possible. This set up will continue
through Monday of next week where 1" to 3" is looking likely. Run off, and minor
flooding of some of our smaller creeks and streams, such as the Lookout Creek is
very likely. We may not get to see the Full Snow Moon this weekend.
