The first Saturday of October will kick off with warm, humid conditions under
partly cloudy skies. Patchy fog will be around during the early morning hours
for a few valley locations. Cloud cover will increase throughout the day as
highs top out in the low to mid-80s. A few pop-up showers will be possible this
evening, but most of us will stay dry.

Rain chances will increase during the overnight hours as a disturbance moves in
our direction. Periods of moderate to heavy rain will continue into the day on
Sunday with much of the area picking up 1-2" of rainfall through Sunday evening.
The increased rain chance on Sunday will keep high temperatures in the mid-70s.

Monday through Thursday will remain active with periods of rain and
thunderstorms. There will be plenty of breaks in the rain, so outdoor plans will
not be a complete washout. Temperatures will remain cooler throughout the week
with highs ranging from 74-78 degrees and overnight lows in the mid-60s. The
current forecast trends have drier weather arriving by Friday!
