Good Friday! Look for the heat and humidity to ramp up heading into the weekend.
Skies will be mostly cloudy with temps falling through the 70s this evening as
you head to the first night of Nightfall at Miller Plaza.

Saturday will be a toasty one with the high reaching the mid to upper 80s and
higher humidity. We will see a few sporadic non severe thunderstorms in the
afternoon.

Sunday we have an increased chance for scattered afternoon storms. We will be a
little cooler in the low 80s, but the humidity will remain high.

The first half of next week will be about the same with lows in the upper 60s,
highs in the low 80s, high humidity, and scattered afternoon storms.
