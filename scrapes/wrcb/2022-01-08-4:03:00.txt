Happy Saturday! We will kick off the weekend with cold morning temperatures
ranging from the low to mid-20s. We will rebound nicely this afternoon as highs
reach near 50 degrees. Skies will remain mostly sunny throughout the day, with a
few high clouds streaming in late this evening.

Our next weather maker will move in during the mid-morning hours on Sunday in
the form of RAIN! The wet weather will continue for much of the day, gradually
tapering off Sunday night. 1-2" of rainfall will fall across the area, with
locally higher amounts possible in the higher elevations. A few rumbles of
thunder may accompany the rain, but any severe threat will remain confined to
the Gulf Coast region.

We will start the work week with plenty of sunshine and chilly daytime
temperatures in the 40s. Highs will return to normal by the end of the week,
with minimal rain chances through Friday.
