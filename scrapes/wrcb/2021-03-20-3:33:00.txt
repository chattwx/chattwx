This evening's weather will be fantastic for grilling out or eating dinner
outside - cool and comfortable. It'll be in the low 60s to upper 50s with sunset
at 7:53pm EDT. Once the sun goes down, temps will drop through the 50s, so
remember a jacket if you're heading out for the night. Overnight lows will be
cold in the mid to upper 30s.

Sunday will have a mix of sun and clouds with clouds arriving from the southeast
in the morning. Highs will be near 65. Another great day to enjoy outside!

Monday will be mostly sunny in the morning with some clouds increasing in the
afternoon. Highs will be warm in the upper 60s to 70. Tuesday will be mostly
cloudy with a few isolated showers possible and highs in the mid-60s. Wednesday
will have scattered showers. Then, rain and a few storms will be more likely on
Thursday. Highs both days around 68. Rain will end Friday morning, clearing up
for a mostly sunny sky and highs in the upper 60s to 70.
