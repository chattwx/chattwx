We will end the week with another glorious day as highs climb into the mid and
upper 60's. We may see a few more high clouds come in, too. Clouds will start to
thicken Friday night. Saturday will see the return of cloudy skies and showers
on occasion. Rainfall amounts will be near a quarter to a half inch. Saturday
night will remain cloudy with a few light showers. Sunday should be cooler with
mid 50's expected. But Sunday will remain dry. Skies should be cloudy to mostly
cloudy. Sunday night, another round of light showers possibly mixing with light
snow showers in the higher elevations will develop. This should end Monday.
Highs Monday will be near 50.

Tuesday looks mostly cloudy to partly cloudy with seasonable temperatures in the
low 50's. Another round of light rain could move in for Wednesday. It will be
colder with highs in the 40's. Thursday should be dry with highs near 50. Paul
