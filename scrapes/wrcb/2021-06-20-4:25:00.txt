Showers will end before 9 AM in most locations across the Tennessee Valley as
Tropical Depression Claudette exits our area. Skies will gradually clear
throughout the day with sunshine returning during the afternoon and evening
hours. Highs will range from the mid to upper 80s with plenty of humidity to go
around. Temperatures will remain mild tonight along with partly cloudy skies.

Our next weather maker will arrive late Monday into early Tuesday morning.
Thunderstorms will develop along an approaching cold front late Monday
afternoon. There will be the potential for a few strong to severe storms with
the primary threat being damaging wind gusts and small hail. Conditions will
begin to improve Tuesday afternoon as the cold front passes to our east. A nice
summertime cool down will settle in for the middle of the week.
