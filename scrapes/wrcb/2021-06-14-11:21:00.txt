TODAY:

It hit 94° both Saturday and Sunday at the airport. I'm forecasting 95° today
with a heat index 97-99°.

The record high for today June 14th is 97 from 1914, so coming close to a record
high!

TUES-THURS:

A dry cold front will move in tomorrow morning - it will be noticeably lower in
humidity on Tuesday, with sunshine and temperatures in the upper 80s.

Tuesday through Thursday look splendid for June with lower humidity and nights
near 60.

THIS WEEKEND:

A wave over the southern gulf near the Bay of Campeche, has a 60% chance of
tropical formation in the next 5 days. IF this happens, it could be a rainy
Father's Day Weekend for us. We'll see with models show by Wednesday.

Tropical Depression TWO has also formed over 100 miles east of Cape Hatteras.
While the depression could become Tropical Storm Bill, it won't have an impact
on land.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunny and Hot, 86 (heat index 91)

3PM Sunny and Hot, 95 (Heat index 99)

6PM: Sunny and Hot, 90 (Heat index 92)
