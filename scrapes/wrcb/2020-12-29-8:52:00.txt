It is a splendid December morning. Clouds will roll in this afternoon, as highs
creep up to the mid 50s. Winds are light today, however winds will be picking up
late tonight in the higher elevations. Winds will be gusting 20-30 mph along the
Cumberland Plateau.

The Cold Full Moon is tonight. Moonrise is at 5:18PM. While clouds will be
increasing during this time, we may get a glimpse of the last full moon of 2020.

Wednesday will be cloudy, and overall rain free. Perhaps an isolated shower by
evening.

THURSDAY-FRIDAY

Showers will be increasing by Thursday evening.

Storms will be possible by Friday morning. Also during this time, non
thunderstorm wind gusts will be picking up, gusting from 30-40 mph. Outside
holiday decor could be blown around on Friday. Winds look to start up, about
3AM-5AM.

While the TN Valley is not under a threat for severe weather during this time,
storms capable of producing wind gusts to 40 mph, too. Heavy rainfall leading to
localized flooding will be possible. Rainfall amounts of 1" to 2" are expected
through New Year's Day.

Note- this is not an arctic front moving through. The weekend will bring
seasonable highs to the 50s, and nights in the low 40s/upper 30s.
