Friday we will see some areas of rain as we head through the mid to late
morning. We will continue with scattered afternoon showers and storms with a
humid high of 86. Saturday we will reach 88 with cloudy skies and only a few
spotty afternoon storms.

A slow-moving front will bring scattered showers and storms to the area Sunday
into Monday at just about any time during the day. Highs will stay in the upper
80s.

Tuesday through Friday will gradually warm from the upper 80s to 90 by the end
of the week. Each day we will have a chance for a few afternoon pop-up storms.

Rain from Elsa will bring flooding to parts of the mid Atlantic and the
northeast through Friday morning.
