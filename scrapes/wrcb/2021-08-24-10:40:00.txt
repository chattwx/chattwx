Wednesday will be another scorcher with a high of 94, and the heat index
settling at 99. We may get one or two pop-up showers or storms that could
produce heavy rain in the afternoon.

 

Thursday will be a little less hot with a muggy high of 90. I expect scattered
afternoon showers or storms.

Friday will reach 89 for the high. The rain chance is low, only 10%.

Saturday and Sunday may see one or two showers, but overall it will be a warm,
nice final weekend of August.

Rain chances increase next week with highs in the mid to upper 80s.
