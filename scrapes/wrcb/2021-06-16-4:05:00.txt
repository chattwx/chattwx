The temperatures and low humidity will be very refreshing this Wednesday
morning. A perfect combination for a morning walk or drinking a cup of coffee
outside. We'll have a sunny sky today with a few fair weather clouds developing
in the afternoon. Highs will be in the mid-80s with a north breeze at 5-15mph.
After sunset, temperatures will drop from the 70s down to the upper 50s to low
60s through the overnight hours with a clear sky.

Thursday will be another great weather day. The humidity will still be low with
highs in the upper 80s and a sunny sky. Heat returns on Friday. Highs will be in
the low 90s with a mostly sunny sky, southerly wind, and increasing humidity.

Saturday will have a partly cloudy sky with highs in the upper 80s. It'll be dry
for most of the day with only an isolated PM shower/storm chance. Then, Father's
Day looks to have scattered showers arriving from the yet to form tropical
system in the Bay of Campeche off of Mexico. This rain should increase overnight
into Monday, and then an approaching cold front Monday night into Tuesday will
produce additional rain and storms.
