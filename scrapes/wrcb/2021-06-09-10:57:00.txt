Our active weather pattern will continue today as another round of scattered
showers and thunderstorms move into the Tennessee Valley. There is no severe
threat, but a few areas of localized flooding will be possible with some of the
heavier showers that move through. High temperatures will range from 78-84
degrees with pesky humidity sticking around all day.

The stormy pattern will continue into Thursday and Friday. Highs will top out in
the low to mid 80s each afternoon with pop-up thunderstorms developing primarily
late in the day.

Rain chances will be lower this weekend as drier air begins to filter into the
area. More sunshine will be around which could push high temperatures back into
the 90s. Temperatures will remain hot heading into early next week along with
generally sunny skies. Forecast models are also indicating lower humidity
readings into next week, bringing a more comfortable air mass to the area!
