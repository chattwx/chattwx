Happy Tuesday, everyone! After another cold start, the sunshine is once again
warming us up quite nicely. Look for plenty of sunshine this afternoon, with a
few high clouds building in late this afternoon. High temps will warm above
normal, in the low to mid 70s! 

Clouds will be on the increase tonight which will help to keep our temperatures
warmer. Overnight lows will only be in the 40s. Wednesday will feature partly
sunny skies, still nice and warm. Highs once again climb into the lower 70s. 

Our cold front arrives on Thursday, bringing clouds and spotty showers during
the morning hours, with more widespread rain and a few rumbles of thunder for
the afternoon hours. Widespread severe weather is not expected at this time, but
rainfall totals between Â½"-1" will be possible. 

The rain will be in and out of the area by Thursday night, followed by blustery
conditions on Friday, with clearing skies. Highs on Friday drop back to near 60.
The weekend will feature a mix of clouds and sunshine with colder conditions.
Highs will only be in the upper 40s to lower 50s, with overnight lows in the
30s. Another shot of colder air looks to arrive by Monday, which could lower
temperatures even more.

Have a great rest of your Tuesday!
