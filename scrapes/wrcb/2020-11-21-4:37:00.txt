Today will be a beautiful day with above normal temperatures from 65-70. There
will be a few spots of patchy fog this morning. Otherwise, expect a mostly sunny
day with scattered clouds streaming by. Tonight clouds will increase slightly
with lows in the upper 40s. Sunday will become mostly cloudy with highs around
67. The first part of the day will be dry for your outdoor plans. However,
starting up around 4pm/3pm CT, a band of showers will move into our western
counties. The chance of showers will continue moving eastward until about
midnight in Cherokee County in NC. Total rainfall should be about 0.25". 

Monday will be mostly sunny and cooler with highs around 60. Tuesday will have
some high, thin clouds and highs near 60 again. Wednesday will be rainy, highs
near 64. Showers will start by lunchtime and continue throughout the day at
about 0.75-1" of rainfall. Wind will likely be gusty at times, but as of now,
the threat of severe weather is low. We'll keep monitoring it and certainly
check back for updates. Thanksgiving will have a mix of sun and clouds with
highs near 65, and the week will end with a partly sunny sky and 64 on Friday.
