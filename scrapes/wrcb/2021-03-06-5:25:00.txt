Good Saturday. This will be a GREAT weekend for anything outdoors. We will be a
sunny, cool, breezy Saturday with highs in the mid 50s and winds from the NE at
10-15 mph. Sunday will be even better. We will start cold in the upper 20s and
low 30s, but warm nicely into the low 60s with clear blue skies. Pollen counts
have been running fairly high for the past few days so you may have some tree
allergies to deal with.

Next week we will start a warming trend that will start Monday afternoon with
sunshine and a high of 65. Tuesday clouds will move in, but no rain. We will
make it to 68 Tuesday. Wednesday we will make it all the way to 73. Friday we
will get into the mid-70s.

While we are enjoying no rain right now, we are looking at dry conditions at
least through Friday and probably through at least NEXT weekend.
