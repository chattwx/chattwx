It's warmed up to pleasant upper 60s and low 70s this Saturday afternoon. Most
locations are experiencing partly cloudy skies, but if you're in Grundy,
Sequatchie, Bledsoe, and Marion, clouds will continue to linger over your area
until tonight. Also, spotty drizzle will last in those counties through about
6pm CT. Overnight will be partly cloudy and even cooler than last night. A lot
of locations will drop into the 40s. Chattanooga at 52.

Sunday will be warmer with highs in the mid-70s. Some morning clouds will give
way to lots of afternoon sun. Memorial Day's highs will increase again to 80-85
with a mostly sunny sky. Really nice weather for a pool or boat day.

Tuesday will have more clouds but will remain warm in the mid-80s. Wednesday
will be partly to mostly cloudy with an isolated shower chance and still in the
mid-80s. Times of rain and storms will then increase for Thursday and Friday.
Temperatures will drop a little in the low 80s.
