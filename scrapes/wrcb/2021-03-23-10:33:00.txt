After a very mild start to this March day, highs will top near 70-71 before
light isolated showers begin this afternoon.

Rainfall totals of 0.01" to 0.20" are possible with the highest over Georgia
this evening.

Most of Wednesday will be dry, with showers arriving overnight and into Thursday
morning.

It's Storm Alert Time starting from Thursday morning through Friday morning.
Multiple rounds of thunderstorms will be possible. The first round comes
Thursday morning. The biggest threat during this time will be heavy rain,
lightning, and damaging wind gusts.

Isolated severe storms (especially south) will be possible in the afternoon
during the day.

Then Thursday night - Friday morning. Depending on dynamics, and given last
week's storm system, new model data suggest a better set up for damaging wind
gusts and a tornado Thursday night. Please check back with the team for new
info.
