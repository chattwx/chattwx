Temperatures will remain unseasonably cool today with highs slowly creeping up
into the low to mid-80s. Pop-up heavy downpours will continue through 9 PM, so
be sure to plan accordingly if you have any outdoor plans this evening. Tonight
will feature partly cloudy skies with lows ranging from 62-66 degrees.

Temperatures will climb back into the upper-80s Thursday and Friday with
humidity building back into the region. Skies will range from partly to mostly
cloudy each day, along with a slim chance of a pop-up afternoon downpour.

The heat and humidity return to August standards this weekend as highs return to
the 90s. A few spotty storms will be around each afternoon, but it looks to be a
great weekend to hit the lake and cool off!
