Good Tuesday. The heat and humidity keep on keeping on. This evening temps will
be dropping through the 80s under partly cloudy skies. The humidity will be
high.

Wednesday through the weekend really offer no relief. Each day will sport
mornings in the low 70s and highs in the low 90s. The heat index will bee in the
upper 90s, and may briefly hit 100. Each day will also see scattered
thunderstorms mainly in the afternoon producing heavy rain, lightning, and gusty
winds. One or two storms could also produce small hail.

Next week we should see the temperature recede a bit with highs in the mid to
upper 80s. The humidity will also be just a little lower so we may get a little
relief.

Potential Tropical Cyclone #6 is in the Atlantic and will likely be in the Gulf
of Mexico as a tropical storm by the end of the week.
