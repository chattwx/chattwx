Good morning! Humidity has been on the rise during the overnight hours. We do
have some patchy valley fog that has developed. It will last until about 9am.
Overall, today will have a mix of sun and clouds -- mostly sunny in the morning
with high thin clouds streaming overhead, especially for areas southwest of
Chattanooga. Then, in the afternoon, it'll be very warm with scattered low-level
clouds. Highs today from 84-89 for most. We'll still have a bit of wildfire
smoky haze, but not as much as yesterday. There's a slim chance for a spotty
evening shower for DeKalb, Jackson, Marion, & Grundy Counties. Overnight will be
partly cloudy with lows in the mid-60s.

Tuesday will be another generally quiet day with mostly sunny skies (clouds
increasing in the evening) with highs near 88 and an isolated PM shower chance.
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday will each have scattered showers and storms,
primarily in the afternoon/evening hours, and highs in the low to mid-80s.
However, the amount of rainfall and coverage area may still change based on
Tropical Storm Nicholas currently off of southeast Texas. There's weak steering
flow for Nicholas but if we get any quicker movement, we could see greater rain
on Wednesday and Thursday locally. Something to watch.
