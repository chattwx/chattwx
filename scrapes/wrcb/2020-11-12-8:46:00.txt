Clouds will continue to erode from west to east today. Highs will range from 70
west of I-75, to the mid 60s east near Murphy and Ellijay.

As skies improve this afternoon, dew points will take a tumble, bringing cooler
nights.

Look for a mostly clear sky tonight with a low of 50. Higher elevations and
outside the city, will be in the mid to upper 40s. Friday will be mostly sunny
with more typical November highs in the upper 60s.

The next rain chance arrives Sunday. A front will move in, bringing only a trace
to 0.20" at best to those west of I-75. It will be even cooler next week with
highs slightly above normal, and with lows in the mid 30s!
