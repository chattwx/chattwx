Enjoy the last bit of Sunday daylight and the beginning of the evening with mild
temps and quiet weather. Showers will arrive around 8PM EST with heavier rain
overnight from about 11PM to 5AM. Then, rain will taper off to scattered
showers, mainly in Tennessee, from 5-10AM on Monday. Rain will total 1-1.5" on
average, up to 2" to the southeast. An isolated rumble of thunder can't be ruled
out along with brief gusty winds, but this is primarily a rain event. 

Additionally, as colder air wraps around Monday morning, a little wintry
mix/snow in the higher elevations will be possible from about 7-10AM EST,
especially in Grundy, Sequatchie, Bledsoe, Marion, and Van Buren Counties. Roads
will be too warm for sticking, but we could have a dusting to 0.5" on elevated
surfaces in those highest areas. Monday will be cooler, staying in the 40s with
a north wind and clouds breaking only slightly. 

Tuesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 50s. Wednesday will have
showers again and cool around 48. We'll watch once again for a little wintry mix
in the higher elevations. Thursday will be partly cloudy with highs only in the
mid-40s. Friday will have lots of sunshine and highs in the upper 40s to 50.
