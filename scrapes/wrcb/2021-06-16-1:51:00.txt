Warm, dry weather will continue for Thursday and hot weather will return for
Friday. Highs on Thursday will be in the upper 80's to near 90 and highs on
Friday will be in the low to mid 90's.

Showers will be isolated late Saturday with highs in the mid-'80s along with a
few more clouds. The remains of a tropical disturbance could come along as early
as Sunday. If it does, we will see showers and storms with highs near 80. Monday
will see more showers and a few storms. Highs Monday will be in the mid-'80s.

There is a chance showers and storms could linger into Tuesday and then again
into Wednesday. If that happens, highs will be in the low 80's.
