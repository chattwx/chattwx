Good Tuesday afternoon. We have a FLOOD WATCH in effect until late tonight for
north GA and NE AL counties. Many of those areas have seen 1.5"-3" in the past
24 hours. We will continue with cloudy skies and a few isolated showers through
the afternoon. This evening we will be cloudy, but have few if any showers
remaining. We should have fine weather for the Lookouts game tonight with temps
dropping through the 70s during the game.

Wednesday will be all about the heat and humidity. Highs will reach the upper
80s with the heat index in the low 90s. Skies will be partly cloudy, and we
won't get more than one or two showers if even that.

Thursday through the weekend will just be hot and humid. Highs each day will be
in the low 90s with the heat index in the mid 90s.

Long range it looks like this muggy pattern may continue through at least the
first part of next week.
