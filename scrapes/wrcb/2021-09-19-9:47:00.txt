Periods of rain will continue tonight, but it looks like the heaviest rain has
ended for now. A Flash Flood Watch is still in effect for most of our area,
excluding our easternmost counties through Monday evening. 1-2" of additional
rainfall tomorrow will lead to localized flooding through Monday night,
especially since the ground is already very saturated. Give yourself a little
extra time on your Monday morning commute.

Scattered showers and storms will continue into Tuesday, but the coverage will
be more hit and miss. High temperatures will remain around 80 degrees.

A cold front will push through the area early Wednesday, bringing showers for
the first part of the day. We will finally begin to clear out Wednesday
afternoon as much drier air filters into the area. The first day of fall is on
Wednesday, and it certainly will feel that way as highs top out in the mid-70s
with overnight lows ranging from 48-55 degrees across the Tennessee Valley.
Fall-like weather with plenty of sunshine will continue through the weekend!
