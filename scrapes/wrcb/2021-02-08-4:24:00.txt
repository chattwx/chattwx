Good Monday. Fire up the seat warmers and bundle up this morning. Temps are in
the 20s as you head out this morning. We will have quite the warm-up this
afternoon, however, with highs making it into the mid 50s, about 10 degrees
warmer than yesterday afternoon.

We will get even warmer Tuesday and Wednesday with lows in the 40s and highs in
the 60s.

Thursday we will have a front bringing in some rain and a few thunderstorms.

We will have more light showers on Saturday afternoon with the high getting up
to only 45.

Sunday we may have some light snow showers in the morning as temps drop to the
mid 20s. We will clear out Sunday afternoon, but the high will only climb to the
upper 30s.
