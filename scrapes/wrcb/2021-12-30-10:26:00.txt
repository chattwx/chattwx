Happy Thursday, everyone! We're looking at mostly cloudy skies today with highs
climbing into the lower 70s. 

off dry, but a warm front lifts north by Friday evening, leading to a few
scattered storms. We will have a low-end risk for one or two of these to produce
isolated severe weather. The more potent storm system arrives on Saturday
afternoon. A line of strong to severe storms will be likely with damaging winds,
and other threats into the evening hours.

Finally, rain, falling temps & blustery conditions will be likely Sunday. We
still even have a chance for some light snow or at least a few flakes to mix in
at the tail end Sunday evening, but the bigger story will be the cold shock for
Sunday night into Monday!

Have a great Thursday!
