Good Friday! Overall the evening will be cloudy and muggy. We may get a pop-up
shower or storm, but they will be few and far between. Any that do pop up will
likely be heavy rainmakers. I think all the football games will be able to go
one with little to no problem. Temps will be in the mid to upper 70s through the
evening.

Saturday we will start cloudy with a few passing showers possible in the
morning. I do expect some isolated storms in the afternoon that could produce
heavy downpours. Highs will be in the mid-80s, and it will be muggy throughout
the day.

Sunday we will turn off the spigot save one or two isolated afternoon storms.
The rain chance is only 10%. The high will climb to a very humid 90 degrees.

We will be rain-free Monday and Tuesday, but the heat and humidity will continue
climbing. Highs both days will be in the low 90s, and the heat index will likely
reach 100 degrees both days.

Temps will drop back into the upper 80s by the end of the week, and we will
reintroduce the rain chances Wednesday through at least next Saturday.
