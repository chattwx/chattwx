RIVER FLOOD WARNING through Tuesday morning for the Sequatchie River near
Whitwell. Only flood warning so far. Only minimal flooding is expected.

We will see just a few spotty showers through the overnight.

Tuesday will be a cloudy day with the high reaching about 80. While we won't
have the same persistent rainfall all day, we will have some sporadic showers
here and there popping up through the day.

Tuesday night into Wednesday morning a cold front will begin working through. It
will bring showers and storms back in through Wednesday morning. Behind the
front we will still see spotty showers through the afternoon with a high of only
73. It will also be windy at times. Wednesday, by the way, marks the beginning
of fall.

Thursday and Friday will be amazing. Lows will be in the low 50s, highs in the
low to mid 70s. Skies will be sunny and the humidity will be really low.

We will keep the nice weather through the weekend with cool mornings and
splendid afternoons both Saturday AND Sunday.
