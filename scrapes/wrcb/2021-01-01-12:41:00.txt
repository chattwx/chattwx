The rain will be heading off to the east of us and we may see a few breaks in
the cloud cover for tonight. Lows will drop into the mid and upper 40's. Skies
will be a mix of sun and clouds for Saturday as highs climb to near 60. Saturday
night will see the return of more clouds with a small chance for some light
scattered showers. Lows should be in the low 40's. Sunday will see a few more
clouds with a cooler high in the upper 40's to near 50.

Monday through Wednesday will be dry with highs in the 50's. Next Thursday
another wave of moisture will head our way and we will probably see more showers
develop. The showers should end Friday. Highs will average near 50. Paul Barys
