Good Friday! We will be cooler and a little breezy today. This afternoon will
sport highs in the mid 50s. This will be a stark contrast to the 70 degree high
yesterday. Clouds will increase this afternoon into tonight We may get a few
light sprinkles tonight through the overnight. I expect us to be a little breezy
today with NE winds at 10-15 mph.

The weekend looks great. Temps Saturday will range from 34 to 61. Sunday we will
go from 34 to 61. Skies will be sunny both days.

Next week we will stay dry with temps warming through the week. Monday we will
have a high of 65. By Friday the high will be in the mid 70s. Now it looks like
any rain will hold off until NEXT Saturday.
