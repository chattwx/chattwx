It will be a pleasant March afternoon with unseasonable highs in the mid to
upper 70s. A southwest breeze will increase this afternoon, with winds gusting
20-25.

Tree Pollen is higher today at 169, still in the Moderate Range, and the AQI is
55. Due to dry air, and a southwest breeze this afternoon, burning is not
allowed today in Hamilton County, per the Tennessee Division of Forestry.

When is the next rain chance? It depends.

Isolated showers are possible now in Tennessee on Friday. This will be light,
and mostly limited to areas north of I-40, but areas like Dunlap, Athens, Spring
City, expected a few isolated showers during the day.

The weekend looks mild in the 70s still. I'm keeping an eye on rain and storms
increasing Sunday night and into Monday of next week. A few strong to severe
thunderstorms will be possible Sunday night into Monday. Check back with the
forecast for new info as Sunday night gets closer.

TODAY:

12PM: Broken Clouds, 68, Slight Breeze

3PM: Broken Clouds, 76, Slight Breeze

6PM: Broken Clouds, 70
