The rest of your Saturday will feature plenty of heat and humidity. Temperatures
will slowly fall from the 90s to the 80s as the sun goes down. A few pop-up
downpours will be possible this evening, but most of our communities will remain
dry. Skies will remain partly cloudy tonight with lows ranging from 69-74
degrees.

The heat will ramp back up tomorrow as highs once again push into the 90s. A few
scattered storms will develop during the heat of the day.

Next week will start with scattered afternoon showers and storms Monday and
Tuesday. By the middle of the week, rain chances will dwindle and temperatures
will turn downright hot. Expect highs to be in the mid-90s Wednesday through
Friday.

In the tropics, we are monitoring an area of low pressure off of the east coast
of Florida. There is a 60% that this area of disturbed weather becomes a
tropical depression in the next 48 hours.
