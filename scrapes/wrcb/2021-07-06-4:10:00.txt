Good morning, today will have comfortable temperatures in the morning, warming
quickly to about 85 by lunch under a mostly sunny sky. Clouds will increase from
the south for the afternoon with seasonable highs from 85-90 along with small
isolated showers. Tonight will be partly to mostly cloudy with lows in the upper
60s to low 70s.

Wednesday will be mostly cloudy in the mid-80s with scattered showers and
storms. A few will be possible in the morning, but the likelihood will increase
for the afternoon and evening. Additional scattered showers and storms will be
possible on Thursday too with an approaching upper trough. During this period of
time, what is left of now Tropical Storm Elsa will be moving through SE Georgia
into South Carolina. Due to the distance, our primary local effects from Elsa
will be increased moisture with higher humidity on Wednesday and Thursday.

The pattern of scattered showers and storms will continue on Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s.
