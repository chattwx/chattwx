Good Friday! We are starting out this morning a few degrees warmer than
yesterday morning. We will be incredibly warm this afternoon with the highs
reaching the very spring-like mid 60s! Clouds will be increasing through the
afternoon into tonight.

We will get a few light showers overnight into Saturday morning. The rain will
be light and scattered. Temps will be in the upper 40s and low 50s, so only
rain, no snow. Temps will climb into the low 60s in the afternoon as the light
rain showers taper off leading to a pleasant Saturday night.

Sunday will be a nice day starting a bit cooler in the morning in the low 40s.
Sunday afternoon will be mostly cloudy with highs around 60. We will have a few
more rain showers late Sunday night into early Monday morning. It will primarily
be rain, but we may see a few areas of wintry mix in the higher elevations.
Rainfall accumulation will be light through the weekend with amounts averaging
around .25" to .5".

Colder air moves in next week. Highs will be in the upper 40s and low 50s. Lows
will be in the 30s. A few more rain showers may move in by Wednesday.
