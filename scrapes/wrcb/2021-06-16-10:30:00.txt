After a really nice evening, we will see temps falling overnight into the upper
50s, 60 in Chattanooga. The humidity will remain low so a cup of coffee on the
porch Thursday morning would certainly not be a bad way to start the day.

Thursday afternoon will be warm and mostly sunny with the high in the upper 80s.
Friday will be a hot one with the high launching to 94. The humidity will start
creeping back in also.

Saturday we are watching for a few outer shower bands from the tropical system
in the Bay of Campeche. It looks to be more of a rainmaker Sunday. Highs over
the weekend will be a very muggy mid to upper 80s.

Another front will move through Monday bringing more rain in Monday and Tuesday.
We should dry back out late Tuesday into Wednesday.

Another couple of notes of interest. Saharan dust is moving across the Atlantic
and may move through the Tennessee Valley Saturday. It will be too high up to
impact us directly, but it may make for a really nice sunset.

Summer officially begins Sunday night at 11:31 pm eastern.
