Good Morning,

Smoke is thick across the entire Tennessee Valley this morning. Smoke is still
forecast to be thick through this evening and into Saturday morning.

I expect the Air Quality Index to be in the high end of the moderate range
today. Areas like Cherokee County, NC are in the Code Orange Air Quality, which
means fine particles are higher in this location.

The haze will stick with us on Saturday, but not as thick. A few showers will be
possible tomorrow near the Blue Ridge Mountains and Ellijay, but that's it.

TREND:

Very hot trend is upon us into the last week of July, and heading into August.
Temperatures will reach the mid 90s by next week, bringing dangerous heat index
values to near 100Â°.

TODAY:

12PM Hot and Hazy, 87 (Heat Index, 92)

3PM: Hot and Hazy, 91 (Heat Index, 96)

6PM: Hot and Hazy, 90 (Heat Index, 95)
