Today will begin with spotty drizzle/light showers during the morning hours
through about 1pm. It'll be isolated at only 20%, and if you receive rain, it
will only amount to a few hundredths or less. Then, Saturday afternoon will be
mostly cloudy with mild highs near 67. The evening will be pleasant with clouds
breaking, becoming partly cloudy overnight with lows in the low to mid 40s.
Sunday will begin mostly sunny in the morning with some clouds developing in the
afternoon. It'll be a nice spring day with highs around 70.

Monday will be mostly sunny and in the low 70s. Tuesday will be our last warm
day of the week at 74 and partly sunny. Then, a cold front will arrive Tuesday
night into Wednesday morning. A few showers will be possible, but they won't
produce much rainfall. The bigger impact will come from the temperature drop.
Wednesday's morning lows will be cool with most locations staying in the 40s and
afternoon highs will only rise to 58. Thursday morning will likely cause
problems with frost developing, even in Chattanooga. Lows will be in the low to
mid-30s. Thursday afternoon will reach the low 60s with a mix of sun and clouds.
Friday will be a bit warmer at 68.
