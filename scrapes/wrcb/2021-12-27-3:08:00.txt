Good morning, the warm weather of the holiday weekend will continue right into
this work (or Christmas break) week. The day begins with areas of patchy fog and
mist. A Dense Fog Advisory is in place until 9am ET for our Georgia communities.
Today will be a mostly cloudy to cloudy day with highs near 68. Wind will be
breezy at times from the southwest at 10-15mph, gusts at 20mph. A couple of
isolated light showers will be possible, primarily at midday and again tonight.
Overnight lows will be mild in the upper 50s to 60.

Thursday will be mostly cloudy with scattered showers. A warm day around 70. The
unseasonable warmth will continue on Wednesday with a high of 72, but rain and
storm chances will also be on the increase. Watch for pockets of heavy rain in
the morning, a bit of a lull period, and then more storms Wednesday
evening/night. It's too early for details, but isolated severe storms do look
possible. The rain chances will continue into Thursday as well with highs in the
low 70s. Friday will be a bit of a break -- partly sunny and 70. Scattered
showers return for Saturday, and then a very strong cold front sweeps through
with rain and a dramatic cool down for Sunday. For the latest, download the WRCB
