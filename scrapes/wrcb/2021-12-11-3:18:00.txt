Happy Saturday, everyone! After a wet, windy, and stormy morning around the
Tennessee Valley, things are beginning to improve area wide. A few leftover
showers will be coming to an end early this evening, otherwise look for gradual
clearing skies with a northerly breeze. The north breeze will usher in cooler
air back to the region. Overnight lows tonight will fall into the low to mid
30s.

Sunday will feature plenty of sunshine and chilly conditions. Highs will
struggle to climb into the lower 50s by the afternoon hours. Clear skies and
light winds will lead to a cold Sunday night with many areas dropping below
freezing in the upper 20s to lower 30s.

Monday will kickoff another week and another warm up! Highs will climb to near
60 with plenty of sunshine. A few extra clouds will increase each day next week,
but temps will also increase each day. Highs by mid to late-week will be in the
mid to upper 60s. Our next weather maker will approach the area by the end of
next week bringing back rain chances the area by next weekend.

Have a great Sunday!
