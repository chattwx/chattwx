Once again, areas of river fog are developing this morning. Fog will be present
until about 9/10am, and then, it's all about the heat. Today will be mostly
sunny with highs in the low 90s and heat index values in the upper 90s. There's
a 10% chance for a spotty shower today, mainly in Cherokee, Fannin, Gilmer, and
Murray Counties. Tonight will be mostly clear with lows in the upper 60s to low
70s.

Wednesday will be another hot day, and the humidity will crank up a notch. Highs
will be in the low 90s with heat indices around 100. Additionally, scattered
showers and storms will develop in the afternoon/evening with a mix of sun and
clouds.

Thursday through Sunday will remain humid, but it won't be quite as hot with
high temperatures near 88 each day. There will also be daily scattered
showers/storms in the range of 30-40% probability.
