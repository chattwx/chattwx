Good Friday! It is a great evening for football or just going out on the town!
Temps will be dropping through the low 80s into the 70s with only modest
humidity and partly cloudy skies.

Saturday looks great. We will start with a cool and refreshing upper 50s and low
60s in the morning, and follow it up with mostly sunny skies and highs in the
low to mid-80s in the afternoon.

Sunday a weak front will pass through. We will get a few scattered showers and
storms in the afternoon and evening hours. They will be very hit and miss.

One or two showers may linger into the overnight, but by the time most of us
wake up Monday morning any rain will be gone, and we will be able to enjoy our
Labor Day with mostly sunny skies and highs in the mid-80s.
