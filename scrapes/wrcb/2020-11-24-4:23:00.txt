Good Tuesday. We are off to a rather cold start with temps in the upper 20s and
low 30s this morning. We will warm to a very seasonable 63 this afternoon with
partly cloudy skies. We may get a bit breezy with winds from the SE at 10-15
mph.

Wednesday is a STORM ALERT WEATHER DAY. We will start mild and cloudy in the
upper 40s, then warm to the low to mid-60s with a few scattered showers possible
through the afternoon. It will be during the evening and into Wednesday night
that we have a line of storms moving through. The biggest threat for severe
storms will be damaging winds west of Chattanooga across the plateau and back
toward middle TN. In middle Tennessee, an isolated tornado can't be ruled out.
The storms will weaken as they move through the Tennessee Valley, but could
still produce up to 1/2" of rain. The timing of the storms moving through will
be between 7pm and midnight.

Thanksgiving Day looks good with temps ranging from 52 to 69 under partly cloudy
skies. Black Friday will get up to 69 with a slight chance for a passing shower.

We may also get a few showers Saturday with rain likely Sunday.
