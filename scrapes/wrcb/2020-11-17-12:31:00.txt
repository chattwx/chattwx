This cool and dry weather pattern will continue into the weekend. Tonight, if
the winds die down enough we will see some scattered frost. Sunshine will rule
for the rest of this week with highs in the upper 50's Wednesday and low 60's on
Thursday. Mid to upper 60's are expected for Friday with a few high clouds on
Saturday and highs near 70. Sunday will see clouds increasing and highs near 70.

The best chance for any rain will be late on Monday and into Tuesday. Highs
Monday and Tuesday will be in the low 60's. Paul Barys
