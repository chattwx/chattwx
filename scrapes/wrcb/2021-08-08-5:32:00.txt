Today will begin with patchy dense fog until about 9am. Otherwise, the morning
hours will have plenty of sunshine. It'll be mostly sunny and in the low 80s for
Sunday brunch, and then the afternoon will become partly cloudy with highs in
the upper 80s to low 90s. I think Chattanooga, Dalton, and Calhoun to name a few
will reach the 90 degree mark. The great majority of locations will remain dry
for your outdoor plans, but a couple of afternoon/evening small downpours can't
be ruled out. Overnight will be partly cloudy with lows in the upper 60s to low
70s.

Monday will be mostly sunny in the morning and partly sunny for the afternoon
with hit and miss showers/storms. Highs will be in the upper 80s to low 90s - 92
in Chattanooga. The heat index reaching the mid-90s. For the rest of the week,
each day will have scattered showers/storms, mainly in the afternoon and evening
hours. Highs in the low 90s with heat index values in the mid-90s. So, as kids
and teachers head back to school, it'll feel more like summertime than this past
week did.
