The weather pattern will change again this week with wetter days ahead. A few
high clouds will through tonight and the clouds will thicken on Tuesday. A few
isolated showers could develop Tuesday through Wednesday. Highs will be in the
mid 60's Tuesday and upper 60's on Wednesday.

The chance for showers and storms will rise quickly on Thursday with some

leftover showers will be ending early Friday with highs still in the 70's. A few
scattered showers will be possible on Saturday with highs again in the '70s.
Sunday could see more showers with highs near 70. Monday should dry up with
mostly sunny skies and highs in the '60s. Paul Barys
