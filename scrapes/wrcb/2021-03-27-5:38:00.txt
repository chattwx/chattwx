Both today and tomorrow are Storm Alert Weather Days. We'll be dealing with 3
rounds of activity. First, this morning there will be individual isolated storm
cells moving from southwest to northeast. The primary threat will be large hail.
Second, we'll have rain from about lunchtime sweeping across our northern
counties with scattered storms developing in the afternoon into the evening. The
primary hazards will be hail and damaging wind. An isolated tornado cannot be
ruled out. All this activity will be slightly more likely for our counties in
Tennessee. Highs today will be warm around 78 with a mostly cloudy sky and wind
from the south at 5-10mph.

The third round will be for Sunday morning. Timing will still fluctuate, but
right now, it looks to be from 5am to noon, we'll have a well developed squall
line of rain and wind move across the area from west to east. The primary threat
with this will be damaging wind on the leading edge. I think power outages will
be possible. Hail and an isolated quick spin-up tornado are low risk, but not
zero. Once the system passes, the rest of Sunday will be calmer. Wind will be
strong from the south in the early morning, then switching out of northwest.
Gusts at 20-30mph.

During the weekend period, we could receive another 1-3" of rainfall with the
higher end totals for our northern counties. Flooding will be a threat as the
ground remains saturated from recent rains.
