Good Friday. It is a sunny and breezy wrap-up to the week. We will stay a little
windy through the evening then see winds die down late tonight. Temps will again
drop into the mid to upper 40s for a cool start to your Saturday.

Clouds will build through the day with only a slight chance for an afternoon
passing sprinkle. Highs will remain in the low 70s.

Mother's Day looks cloudy, but good for the most part. It will certainly be
warmer with temps ranging from 55 in the morning to 80 in the afternoon.

Late Sunday night through Monday early afternoon we will see a front bring in
scattered showers and thunderstorms. They will end late Monday with a high of
72.

Tuesday and Wednesday look dry with highs in the mid to upper 60s and lows in
the low 50s.
