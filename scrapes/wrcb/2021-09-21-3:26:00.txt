Good Tuesday. Through the evening we will continue to see mild, humid, cloudy
weather punctuated by a few spotty showers here and there. That will last
through the overnight. Wednesday morning a cool front will push through bringing
more widely scattered showers and a few storms to the area. We could see some
heavy rain for the Wednesday morning commute.

Fall officially begins at 3:21 pm eastern, and as if on cue, we will start
seeing skies clearing out, humidity dropping, and the temperature cooling.
Wednesday evening will also be a bit breezy as the front passes through with
winds from the NW at about 15 mph.

Thursday and Friday will be amazing with lows around 50 and highs in the upper
60s and low 70s. Skies will be sunny, and the humidity will stay low.

The weekend will be perfect. We will warm a bit, but still sport lows in the 50s
and highs in the mid to upper 70s Saturday and Sunday. We will remain sunny with
low humidity.

Next week will start warm and nice with mostly sunny skies and highs in the low
80s Monday and Tuesday.
