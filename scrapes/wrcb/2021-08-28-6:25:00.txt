The rest of your Saturday will feature mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies.
Temperatures will hold steady in the 80s as you venture out for Saturday evening
plans. Lows will drop into the 70s tonight under partly cloudy skies.

The remnants of Hurricane Ida will have implications on our weather heading into
next week. Ida is forecast to make landfall in southeastern Louisiana as a major
hurricane late Sunday. Ida will continue an inland trek and remnants will arrive
in the Tennessee Valley early Tuesday morning. Periods of heavy rain with breezy
winds will likely impact the area Tuesday and gradually end early Wednesday.
Total rainfall amounts of 2-4" will be possible with higher amounts in our
southwestern communities. We will also be on the lookout for a few strong to
severe storms, especially on Tuesday.

The remnants of Hurricane Ida will be long gone by the end of the week as drier
air filters into the area. Thursday and Friday will feature plenty of sunshine,
lower humidity, and high temperatures only topping out in the mid-80s!

Enjoy your weekend, and don't forget to download the WRCB weather app for the
