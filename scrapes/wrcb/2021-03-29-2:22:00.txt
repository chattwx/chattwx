Another cold front has set its sights on us. Clouds will be increasing for
Tuesday as the front approaches. Gusty south winds will start up into the
afternoon and evening. Highs should be climbing into the mid and upper 70's.
Overnight showers and a few storms could develop with a mild low in the low
60's. Wednesday will see showers and storms. Some of the storms could be strong
at times. The front will pass and that should cut off the rain overnight. Winds
will be strong and out of the northwest to 20 and gusty. Thursday will see skies
clearing rapidly with a cold high in the mid 50's. Friday morning will see a
cold low near 31, but it will be in the 20's away from the city. So, we may see
freezing conditions in many spots. Saturday and Sunday will both be sunny with
highs in the mid to upper 60's. Monday will be warmer with highs in the mid 70's
and partly cloudy skies. Paul Barys
