Good morning, today will begin mostly sunny and pleasant, but it'll warm up
quickly. Noon temperatures in the mid-80s followed by highs around 90 - about 92
in Chattanooga. Today will also be humid with the heat index reaching the
mid-90s. It'll become partly cloudy for the afternoon with a few small
downpours/storms lasting into the evening. Overnight will have lows in the upper
60s to low 70s.

Off of the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina this morning is a low pressure
system that may form into a Tropical Depression or Tropical Storm later today.
Regardless of its formation, that energy and moisture will track inland,
bringing us scattered rain and storm chances for Tuesday with a partly sunny
sky. Highs will be a bit cooler in the mid-80s.

Then, Wednesday and Thursday should be back up into the upper 80s to 90 with hit
and miss showers/storms. Widespread rain will increase on Friday associated with
a cold front with about 1-2" possible. Highs will drop to the low 80s.
