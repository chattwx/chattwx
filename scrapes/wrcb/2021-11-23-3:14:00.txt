Below freezing temperatures to start Tuesday with many locations in the 20s, so
bundle up this morning. We have a sunny day ahead with below normal highs in the
upper 40s to low 50s. Wind will be light from the north. The clear sky will
continue through tonight if you want to do any planet or stargazing with lows
again from 25-30.

Wednesday will have a mix of sun and clouds with highs in the mid-50s. If you're
driving within the southeast, you should have no weather issues for travel.
Thanksgiving will begin dry for 5k races, meals outside, or frying a turkey.
Highs will be milder near 60. Rain showers will then return for the evening
hours associated with another cold front. Rain will move from west to east from
about 4pm to 2am ET. Totaling 0.1-0.25".

Friday will be colder again with highs near 48 and mostly sunny. Good, dry
weather for going in and out of stores for Black Friday shopping. Both Saturday
and Sunday will be mostly sunny with highs around 55. For the latest, download
