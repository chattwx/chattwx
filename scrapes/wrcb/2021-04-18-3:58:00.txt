A great end to the weekend with pleasant temperatures this evening in the 60s.
Clouds will increase tonight with a small chance for a few isolated
showers/sprinkles from about 10pm to 4am, mainly in Tennessee. Overnight lows
will be cool in the mid-40s.

Monday will be a beautiful, mostly sunny day with highs in the low 70s. Tuesday
will be a tad warmer around 75 with a southerly breeze.

Then, come big changes. A cold front will pass on Wednesday morning. A few light
showers will be possible, but the main impact will be the much colder air
ushered in behind it. Wednesday's morning lows won't be too bad in the upper 30s
to low 40s for most, but areas along the Cumberland Plateau will be colder.
Daytime highs on Wednesday look to be around 54 with a brisk NW breeze and
decreasing clouds. Wednesday night into Thursday morning will be the coldest
with lows in the low to mid-30s. Outlying locations should be freezing, metro
areas watching for frost. After the cold morning, Thursday will be mostly sunny
with highs near 64. Areas outside of Chattanooga will need to watch for frost
again on Friday morning. It'll warm up to 67 and partly sunny in the afternoon.
Then, rain showers return on Saturday.
