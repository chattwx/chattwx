Good Morning Tennessee Valley!

DANNY

Danny has dissipated over Georgia this morning. We will however get a few
scattered showers from the remnants in the afternoon, mainly from 12PM-6PM.
Winds may gust to 15 mph today, but that would be it, as the storm has already
weakened.

GRASS

Grass has risen to the High Category. In July, Grass will continue to be the
biggest allergen, however August is really when Ragweed begins. Joy!

FRIDAY
The end of the week will be a wet one. Rainfall by Friday will bring 1" to 1.5"
of widespread rain. Thunderstorms will be possible, too. If this pattern holds
true, we'll get a few nice mornings on Saturday and Sunday, along with a break
in the humidity! At this time, plan on heading out on the water Saturday,
Sunday, and Monday.

WEEKEND

As folks make plans for the holiday weekend, we can get more specific starting
Wednesday, as it's really too far to pinpoint. Today - the forecast model data
is trending drier for Saturday-Monday. That would certainly be great - I'm
lowering the rain chances, however still keeping small pops in for the sake of
the trend.

TODAY:

12PM: Scattered Clouds, 85 (Heat Index, 89)

3PM: Showers/Storms developing south, 90 (Heat index, 94)

6PM: Showers/Storms fading, 84 (Heat Index 88)
