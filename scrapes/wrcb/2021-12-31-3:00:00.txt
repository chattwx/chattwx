Good Friday! Expect spotty showers and storms this evening. There is an outside
chance for a storm or two producing damaging winds so be weather aware as you
head out for New Year's Eve. Temps will be in the mid-60s through tonight.

Saturday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. We will start with scattered showers and
storms through the morning. The afternoon will be fairly quiet as we warm to a
near-record 75 degrees. In the evening we will see a cold front bring in a line
of storms that will move through the Tennessee Valley Saturday night into Sunday
morning. The biggest risks from this line will be damaging winds and isolated
tornadoes. Heavy rain and lightning will also be a concern.

Temps will fall dramatically as the front passes, and we may even see the
remaining moisture change over to a wintry mix Sunday evening into Sunday night.

Next week will start cold with temps in the upper 20s Monday and Tuesday
morning. Highs will only make it to the mid to upper 40s.
