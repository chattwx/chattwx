A few downpours will be around during the evening hours before fading into the
night. Temperatures will range from 64-70 degrees tonight, accompanied by partly
cloudy skies.

The heat and humidity will be around tomorrow as highs top out in the mid to
upper 80s. Daytime heating will result in a few pop-up afternoon showers and
thunderstorms after 3 PM.

Rain chances will be low Monday but will gradually increase throughout next
week. The highest rain chances will develop Thursday-Saturday as a disturbance
moves in our direction. Higher rain chances will also result in slightly cooler
temperatures as we wrap up the upcoming week!
