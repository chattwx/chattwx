Today will be a day to simply have your raincoat handy. We'll have on and off
scattered showers throughout Friday with cloudy skies. There should be a bit of
lull period with lower rain chances in the afternoon, and then another burst
with the potential of a few storms for the evening from about 5-9pm. Much of the
daytime will be spent in the 50s with the official high happening shortly before
midnight in the low 60s.

Saturday is our Storm Alert Weather Day as a line of heavy rain and storms
associated with a cold front will pass through our area from west to east. The
strongest storms with isolated severe risk should be along the leading edge of
the system. The timing for this main line should be 8am-3pm ET. Chattanooga's
timing about 10am-1pm. The primary hazard will be damaging wind gusts, but an
isolated tornado will also be possible. Please, secure Christmas decorations,
and we may end up with a few power outages and tree damage. After the storms,
rain showers will continue until about 9pm. Flooding is not much of a concern
with this event, but do be mindful of rainwater runoff on roads. Total rainfall
0.5-1.5", locally up to 2". Highs on Saturday will be around 68 in the late
morning or midday, then falling for the rest of the afternoon. Sunday will be
colder again with a sunny sky.
