Good Tuesday. We are off to a cold start, and it will remain chilly all day with
highs this afternoon only making it into the mid to upper 50s.

The cold air will keep filtering in through Wednesday morning as we drop into
the mid to upper 20s. Wednesday afternoon, however, we will have quite the warm
up with temps reaching about 60 degrees under sunny skies. Thursday will be even
warmer with temps ranging from 35 to 65. Friday we will start out at 40 in the
morning and climb to 63 with increasing clouds through the day.

While Saturday still looks like we will have rain showers on and off, the amount
of rain is being adjusted down to .25" to .5" through the day. We will be warm
all day with lows in the 40s and highs near 60. Skies will be mostly cloudy
Sunday, but I don't expect rain. We will hit 57 for the high.

Next week we will cool back down a bit with lows in the 30s and highs in the low
50s for the first part of the week.
