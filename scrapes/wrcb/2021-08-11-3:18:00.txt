Good Wednesday. We have more scattered showers and storms popping up through the
afternoon. Heavy rain, lightning, gusty winds, and small hail will all be on the
menu with developing storms. Through the evening the rain chance will evaporate
with the loss of daytime heating. Temps this evening will be in the low 80s
under partly cloudy skies.

Thursday through Saturday really don't offer anything different. Highs will be
in the low 90s. The heat index will be in the upper 90s. Scattered storms will
be likely each day, mainly during the afternoon.

Sunday we will also have scattered storms, but we may be a degree or cooler with
a high of 89.

Next week we will see temps receding a bit into the mid to upper 80s. The
humidity will fall slightly as well.

We are keeping an eye on Tropical Storm Fred. The exact track is still very
uncertain, but it could be a rainmaker for the Tennessee Valley by Monday or
Tuesday.
