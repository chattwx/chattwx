Enjoy the rest of this Saturday afternoon and early evening as clouds slowly
break across the region. Most locations are done with rain by now, and the last
bit will exit Cherokee County in NC by about 4:30pm today. The evening hours
will be quiet, except for a southerly breeze, and it'll be comfortable in the
60s to 70. 

Then, from about 8pm to 3am from west to east, a few spotty showers/downpours
will sweep across the area along a passing cold front. Clouds will clear up with
overnight lows from 45 to 50.

Sunday will be a wonderful day to enjoy outside. Sunshine, blue sky, and just a
few clouds along with highs from 70-74. Wind from the WSW at 5-15mph. Monday
will be mostly sunny and even warmer in the upper 70s to 80. Then, Tuesday
through Friday will have a mix of sun and clouds each day. We'll call it partly
cloudy overall. Tuesday in the low 70s and then cooler on Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday in the upper 60s to 70.
