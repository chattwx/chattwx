A Storm Alert Weather Day will continue through this evening. The two main
concerns will be flash flooding and the potential for isolated severe storms.

Flash Flooding Threat: A Flash Flood Watch is in effect until 8 AM Thursday for
the entire coverage area. 2-4" of rainfall will be possible over the next 24-36
hours with locally higher amounts. The flash flooding potential will be highest
along streams, creeks, and low-lying areas.

Severe Weather Threat: A marginal (level 1/5) risk for severe weather will be
possible for areas west of I-75. The main concern will be hail up to the size of
quarters and gusty winds from 40-60 mph. A spin-up tornado cannot be ruled out
but is unlikely. The main time frame for severe storms will be between 2-9 PM.

Be sure to have a way to receive weather alerts over the next two days as rounds
of heavy rain and thunderstorms continue. We will begin to clear out during the
day on Friday, setting up a gorgeous weekend across the Tennessee Valley.
