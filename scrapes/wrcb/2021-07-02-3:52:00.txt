On and off showers will continue until about 10am today. After that time, only a
stray spotty shower will happen through the early afternoon. The biggest
difference post 10:00 will be improving weather for the rest of Friday. Clouds
will slowly decrease, wind will shift out of the north, and drier air will
filter in. Friday afternoon will become partly sunny with highs from 82-86 for
most. By tonight for fireworks shows, it'll be mostly clear and in the 70s.
Overnight, humidity will drop significantly with lows in the low 60s.

Saturday will be fantastic! We'll have low humidity, abundant sunshine, and
highs near 85. Independence Day on Sunday will be warmer with highs in the upper
80s to 90 with a sunny sky. The humidity will start to rise slightly, but it'll
still be bearable. Both days will have great weather for boating, pooling,
grilling, fireworks, etc.

Monday will be hot in the low 90s and more humid with a mix of sun and clouds.
Tuesday will be partly sunny and in the low 90s with an isolated shower.
Wednesday and Thursday will be muggy with scattered showers and storms.
