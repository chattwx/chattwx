The Air Quality is better today with an index of 50. Pollen counts have risen
over the last 24 hours, to 372. Tree Pollen is high, however, Ragweed appears to
be beginning.

Burning is not allowed today in Hamilton County.

Temperatures will warm today to the upper 70s near 76-77. The record high today
is 81 from 2006. I don't see us breaking records, but certainly noteworthy!

Isolated showers (very light) will return on Friday. Mainly in the afternoon and
evening a trace to 0.05" is possible. Temperatures will still reach the mid 70s
tomorrow.

An isolated shower is possible again Saturday and Sunday before rain and storms
arrive Monday. New forecast model data indicates rain and thunderstorms by
Monday. Rainfall amounts on Monday of 1" to 2" is possible.

New Drought Monitor released today shows hardly any change, which is great news.
Southern Gilmer county is Abnormally Dry, but that's it for the Tennessee
Valley.
