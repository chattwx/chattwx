Sunday will begin with comfortable temperatures in the morning in the 60s and
70s with a mostly sunny sky, but it'll warm up quickly. By noon, it'll be in the
low 80s. Afternoon highs today will range from 87-91 for most. I'm forecasting
91 for Chattanooga. If we break into the 90s, it'll be the first time since
September of last year.

It'll be a great weekend "summer" day to spend outside, but there are 2 things
to consider. First, the UV Index will be "Extreme" today, so make sure to have
sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat, and use more caution around water (pool, river) as
the sunlight will reflect. Second, the air quality will be lower today,
especially as ground level ozone develops in the afternoon with the heat. The TN
Dept. of Environment and Conservation has issued a Code Orange Health Advisory
for the Chattanooga metro area - "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups." The general
public is not likely to be affected. Active children and adults, and people with
a respiratory disease such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.

The air quality should remain lower for Monday and Tuesday as well. We'll let
you know if a future alert is issued for those days. Otherwise, it'll remain hot
with a mix of sun and clouds. Highs on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in the low
90s. Only a couple of sporadic light showers will be possible on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
