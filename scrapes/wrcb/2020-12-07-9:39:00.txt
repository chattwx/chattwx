Good Monday. We start the week a little cool and breezy. Temps will be slowly
falling through the day behind a cold front. We will be around 40 degrees
through most of the afternoon, cooling into the upper 30s by the time folks are
heading home from work. We will also be breezy through the day with winds from
the NW at 10-15 mph. We MIGHT see a few flurries in the Blue Ridge Mtns. this
afternoon, but nothing to get excited about.

Temps will continue falling tonight into the mid to upper 20s by Tuesday
morning. The high Tuesday will only reach about 49. Skies will be sunny.

Wednesday we will start cold, in the 20s, but we will warm nicely into the up
50s under mostly sunny skies.

Thursday will be a nice warm day with temps ranging from a cool 33 in the
morning to 65 in the afternoon. It will stay warm all day Friday going from 51
in the morning to 61 later in the day.

Saturday another front will bring rain through much of the day into the evening.
I expect up to an inch of rain. We will clear out Sunday and be a little cooler.
I expect morning temps in the low 30s, and afternoon highs where they should be
in the low 50s.
