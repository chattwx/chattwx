Today will start of very cold with a mostly clear sky, but clouds will increase
for a mostly cloudy to overcast afternoon. Highs today will be well above
freezing in the low 50s. Scattered rain showers will develop in the afternoon
into the evening, moving northward. During this time, wintry mix and some snow
will be possible in our higher elevations, most likely in the Blue Ridge
Mountains to the east. A lull period will last from about 10pm to midnight.
Then, a second system approaches from the west with wintry mix and snow. Most of
the valley will have temperatures above freezing the entire time, so roads
should be fine with very limited (if any) snow accumulation on grassy and
elevated surfaces. Higher elevations could see quick bursts with 1-2" on
average, locally up to 3". Then, lower amounts expected as you come down
ridgelines back to the valley.

Please use caution driving on the higher elevation roads, especially in the
eastern mountains, tonight. Roads may become slick while snow and mix are
actively falling with lasting accumulations possible, too. Overnight lows will
range from freezing to the mid-30s.

The system will be done by about 8am on Sunday morning. Then, clouds will
decrease with a mostly sunny afternoon and highs in the mid-40s. Monday will be
mild in the mid-50s and mostly sunny. Tuesday and Wednesday around 60.
