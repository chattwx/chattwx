This evening will be a chilly one with mostly cloudy skies and temps in the low
to mid-30s. Overnight we will fall into the upper 20s. While major roadways are
fine, untreated surfaces in outlying and elevated areas could easily still have
areas of ice on them. Travel safely Tuesday morning.

Tuesday afternoon will feature periods of sun and clouds and a tolerable high of
49.

Wednesday an approaching front will warm us a bit. We will start at 35 and climb
to a very nice 53. Rain will move in late Wednesday into Wednesday night. I
expect about an inch of rain with this system. The rain will linger overnight,
and as the cold air behind the front mixes in we could see some light snow
showers early Thursday morning. Temps will be in the low to mid-30s. Some areas
of ice may be possible. We will clear out through the day with temps only
reaching the upper 30s for the afternoon highs.

A low will be moving by to the south Friday and Saturday. It could bring more
wintry weather, but the models are up in the air concerning how much and when,
and it is also a LONG way off.
