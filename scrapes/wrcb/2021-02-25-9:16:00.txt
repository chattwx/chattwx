Another spring-like and blissful Thursday afternoon is ahead of us. The morning
low was only 50° in Chattanooga, and it's approaching 60° already as of 10AM.
Even with a north wind today, plenty of sunshine will help temperatures soar to
near 70° this afternoon.

Clouds will roll in again this evening, mainly after 6PM.

Rain begins Friday morning 3AM-5AM, and continues through Friday evening.
Rainfall amounts tomorrow will range from 0.75" to 1" by tomorrow. Then
overnight Friday into Saturday morning another round of rain comes. This looks
limited to our Tennessee counties.

SATURDAY:

Saturday will not be a wash out. Perhaps some sprinkles in the
afternoon/evening, but when rain moves out Saturday morning, it will be done for
most of the day.

SUNDAY:

Sunday morning looks dry, too. Itching to be in the garden? Sunday morning looks
good, as temperatures will be mild in the morning in the mid 50s. Rain will
increase by evening on Sunday, and due to this being a little bit later in the
day now, temperatures look to make it to the 70s Sunday. Due to warmer
temperatures, we'll need to watch for thunderstorms Sunday evening, too.

As rain and perhaps a few thunderstorms arrive Sunday-Monday - this is when
we'll be watching for localized flooding. On top of the 1" that will have
already fallen, an additional 1" to 3" will be possible from Sunday through
Monday. Runoff from small creeks and streams is very possible come Monday.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunshine, 64

3PM: Sunshine, 70

6PM: Increasing Clouds west, 68
