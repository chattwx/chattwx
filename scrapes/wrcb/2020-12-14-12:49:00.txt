I am not expecting any warm temperatures like we saw last week. Seasonable
temperatures will be the rule and at times it will be colder than normal. Highs
on Tuesday will be in the low 50's with mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies.
Wednesday will see another round of rain move in with a cold high in the mi
40's. Thursday will be partly cloudy with highs again in the mid 40's.

Friday will see some high clouds moving by. Highs will be near 50. Saturday will
see more clouds moving in with highs in the low 50's. Sunday will be mostly
cloudy with a few light showers mainly in Georgia. Next Monday will be mostly
sunny with highs in the mid 50's. Paul Barys
