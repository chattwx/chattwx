We made it through the morning snow, and now what's left is the cold. It'll
struggle to get out of the 30s today with highs topping out in the upper 30s to
around 40. The wind is brisk and fierce, creating wind chills at lunch in the
20s and only warming to around 33 this afternoon. Clouds will partially clear in
the afternoon with the greatest clearing Monday evening. Once the sun sets,
it'll get even colder quickly with overnight lows in the low to mid-20s. Please
be careful driving overnight and Tuesday morning due to patchy black ice,
especially along the higher elevations which received snow and in sheltered
areas with standing water. The wind today and tonight will help reduce its
formation, but it's still a good idea to use caution.

Tuesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the upper 40s. Wednesday will have a
mix of sun and clouds with highs in the low 50s. Thursday will be another day to
watch with rain showers, but also the potential for a changeover to snow by
nighttime as it gets colder again. Then, Friday will be partly sunny with a low
of 23 in the morning and only reaching 42 for the high.
