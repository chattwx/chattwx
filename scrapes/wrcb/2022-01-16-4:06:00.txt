Happy Sunday! It is a Storm Alert Weather Day as we anticipate rain changing to
snow across much of the area. The transition will likely begin this morning for
the Plateau between 6-9 AM. It will take the cold air longer to arrive in the
valley, which will lead to a transition between 1-4 PM this afternoon. The
biggest question is how long the transition will take in the valley. If it
occurs earlier in the day, higher accumulations will be possible to the valley
floor.

A heavy band will likely set up along the Plateau, leading to impressive
snowfall totals. Regardless, everyone in the area will see some form of snowfall
throughout the day.

Current Snowfall Forecast:

Cumberland Plateau: 4-8"+

Eastern mountains: 2-5" with higher amounts for elevations above 4,000 ft

Valley/North Georgia: Dusting-2"+

NE Alabama: 2-4"

Metro Mountains: 1-3"

Timing of Transition to Snow:

Cumberland Plateau: 4-8 AM Sunday

Eastern mountains: 7-10 AM Sunday

Valley/North Georgia: 1-4 PM Sunday

NE Alabama: 10 AM-1 PM Sunday

A bulk of the moisture will move out by Sunday night, with just a few lingering
flurries around Monday morning.
