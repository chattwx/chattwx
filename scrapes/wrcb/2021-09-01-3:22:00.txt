Good Wednesday. It was a wet August. As a matter of fact, it was the second
wettest on record dating back to 1879. The wettest August was 12.36" in 1920. We
came close with 11.48" in the books.

As we head into September, though, all that is behind us, and we will start the
month on a tremendous note. Tonight we will see skies clearing out and the
humidity dropping which will allow for a much cooler morning. I expect temps in
the low 60s tomorrow morning. It will only warm to about 82 in the afternoon
under sunny skies. With the lower humidity, it will feel amazing outside all
day.

Friday and Saturday will basically be a repeat. Both mornings will be in the low
60s, and both afternoons will be around 85. Sunday will sport temps ranging from
67 to 85, and another weak front moving through may bring a couple of stray
showers on Sunday afternoon.
