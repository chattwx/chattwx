Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day. We'll have 2 rounds of showers and storms
with the second one this evening having potential for isolated severe storms.

Round 1 will be in the morning with scattered showers/storms from about 8am to
1pm ET. There may be brief gusty wind with these, but the biggest threat will be
localized heavy downpours.

There will then be a lull period for the early afternoon when we may see some
breaks in the clouds with warm highs in the mid-70s. Any sun we get will
destabilize the atmosphere to help fuel the evening storms.

Round 2 will be along a cold front from about 5pm to 11pm ET from west to east.
It will be a broken line of storms. This period is the one when we may see an
isolated severe storm with damaging wind gusts and small hail along with
lightning and heavy rain. Please, use caution for your evening commute for
Thursday night plans that take you outside.

Friday will be cooler with highs only near 68 and partly sunny. Saturday looks
beautiful with highs in the low 70s and mostly sunny, and then warmer on Sunday
near 78 and a spotty shower chance.
