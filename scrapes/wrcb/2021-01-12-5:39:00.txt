Good Tuesday. We have a cool start today in the 30s. There is still a bit of
snow on the ground in the higher elevations, but I don't think there will be
much ice on the roads other than maybe a few spots on bridges or overpasses
where the temperature might be a few degrees colder. Road temps this morning are
above freezing in most spots. This afternoon we will have clearing skies with a
high in the mid to upper 40s.

Wednesday we will have a cold start in the low to mid 20s, maybe even the 10s in
the Blue Ridge. It will be mostly sunny and about 50 in the afternoon.

Thursday will also be dry with temps ranging from 29 to 54. Friday will be
cloudy with a mild morning in the upper 30s. We will climb to a high of 50 with
a slight chance for a sprinkle as a cold front slides through.

Saturday will be colder with cloudy skies and a high of only 42. We MAY get a
few flurries through the day, but they will be few and far between.

Sunday we will start in the upper 20s and climb to 45. Some models are starting
to show a wintry mix Sunday night and snow showers early Monday morning. Stay
tuned.
