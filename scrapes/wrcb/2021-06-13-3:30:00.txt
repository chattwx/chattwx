Enjoy the hot and humid afternoon. We're still looking at dry conditions through
the early evening hours. The heat index will stay in the 90s through 8pm for the
Chattanooga metro area. Then, tonight from about 8pm to 4am, pockets of showers
and storms (20%) will move into our area from the north. Since storms won't
initiate in our local area until closer to dusk or after dark, we're not
expecting as strong of activity as yesterday evening. That being said, any
summertime storm can produce heavy rain, lightning, and brief gusty wind. Lows
will be in the upper 60s to low 70s.

Monday will be mostly sunny with highs from 90-94 for most. An initial cold
front will pass during the day, dropping humidity slightly and bringing a spotty
shower chance. A second cold front will bring in drier, more comfortable air
Monday night into Tuesday morning. Thus, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday will
be very nice. Highs in the mid-80s, lower humidity, and lots of sunshine. It'll
get hot again by Friday with a high of 92.
