Good Wednesday. We will see the warmth and humidity lingering through the
evening. We may also see a few stray showers or storms producing heavy rain on
and off into the overnight as a cold front works through.

Thursday will be one to write about in your diary. We will start at 66 in the
morning and only make it to 83 in the afternoon. Many will not get out of the
70s. Skies will be blue, and the humidity will be low. It will be a bit windy at
times with north winds from 10 to 20 mph.

Friday will be amazing also. It will be cool in the morning mid to upper 50s. We
will again hit a sunny 83 in the afternoon.

The humidity stays low through the weekend, but we will see temps climbing a bit
with the high reaching 86 Saturday and 89 Sunday. Still, the weekend weather
will be great for anything outdoors.

Next week will be dry, but a little more humid and warm with highs near 90.
