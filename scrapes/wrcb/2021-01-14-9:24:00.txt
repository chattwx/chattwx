It will be a cold day for those up I-75, as mist and freezing fog continues
through early afternoon there.

The rest of the Tennessee Valley will get sunshine through the afternoon, with
temperatures hitting 52-53 today. It will be a nice afternoon to be outside and
get fresh air with our furry friends.

Clouds will roll in tonight, bringing very light rain after midnight until 7AM
Friday morning. A few hundredths of an inch of rainfall 0.01" to 0.05" is
expected. Mountain flurries will be possible from 3AM-7AM, too, however no snow
accumulation is expected.

Saturday will bring a better chance for light snow accumulation. Beginning
around 8AM-9AM light snow will begin in our Tennessee Counties. Here is what I'm
thinking for snow amounts by Saturday afternoon:

1/4" to 1/2" for Grundy, Sequatchie, and Bledsoe

1/2" to 1" for eastern Monroe, and northern Cherokee

everyone else under 0.20", and Georgia and Alabama getting a trace to 0.10"

TODAY:

12PM: 45, Sunshine

3PM: 53, Sunshine

6PM: 49, Clouds increasing
