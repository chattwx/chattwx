The tree pollen explosion is typically in the next week or two. Those needing
relief from tree pollen allergies - tree pollen is lower in the afternoons as
trees release pollen first thing in the morning. For those working outside
-afternoons should be better for you.

Sunshine will continue for our Monday with highs in the mid 60s.

Next chance for rain and thunderstorms arrives on Wednesday. A few showers look
possible late Tuesday night after 11PM, however there is a Marginal Risk for
severe weather on Wednesday. While this is the low end of the severe threat
legend (Level 1), a few strong isolated storms will be possible. Timeframe looks
to be mid morning through mid afternoon on Wednesday.

Did you put your big outdoor plants outside? Bring em back in this week.
Temperatures will take a dive by Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights this
week with several hours air temperatures in the mid to low 30s. Freezing
temperatures will damage tropical plants. How do you know if it's tropical? Feel
the leaf. Is it thick? It means it has water in it. Leaves that hold more
moisture (water) will have a greater chance for damage later in the week,
especially Thursday night (Friday morning).
