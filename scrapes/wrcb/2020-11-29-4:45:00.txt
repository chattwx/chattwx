Sunday will begin quietly with a mostly cloudy to overcast sky, highs around 60,
and a southeasterly breeze. An active weather pattern will run from Sunday
afternoon into Tuesday morning. Everyone will experience rain, gusty wind, and a
drop in temperatures. Some will see snow.

Light rain showers will arrive from the south by about 3pm EST on Sunday. Rain
coverage and rates will increase through Sunday night with a few embedded
thunderstorms. Total rainfall from 0.75-1.25", locally higher is possible. Light
rain showers will end Monday morning, and cold air will move in. As temperatures
drop on Monday, the residual moisture will be squeezed out. A wintry mix will be
possible in the morning hours for the Cumberland Plateau. The greater chance for
winter precipitation will come Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning with
some flurries (valley) and light snow showers (higher elevations). Any
accumulations will be light on grassy and elevated surfaces in the higher
elevations and northern counties. Generally speaking 0.1-0.5" of snow with 1" in
the highest terrain locally. Please, still be careful driving.

During this period of time on Monday, the wind will be gusty. Highs will be
around midnight with morning through lunchtime temperatures around 40, then
falling for the rest of the day through the 30s. Winter coats will be needed. On
Tuesday, highs will only be in the upper 30s to low 40s and wind chills in the
20s to mid-30s. It will be a mostly sunny sky. Wednesday morning will start in
the low to mid-20s with afternoon highs around 50 and sunny.
