It'll remain in the 80s through sunset this Saturday evening. If you're heading
out to the Red Wolves home opener. It should be around 87 for the start of the
game at 7pm, dropping into the low 80s as the game progresses. Sunset is at
8:43pm EDT in Chattanooga, and it should be a pretty one with the high thin
clouds. Overnight, the wispy clouds persist with lows in the low 60s - 64 in
Chattanooga. 

Sunday will be mostly sunny. Once again having the combination of high thin
clouds and then fair weather cumulus clouds developing in the afternoon. Highs
will be in the upper 80s to low 90s. For IRONMAN 70.3, temperatures will be
comfortable in the morning through most of the bike portion, but certainly
heating up for the running section - around 84 at noon and 88 by 2pm.

The heat will kick in even more for the start of the work-week. Highs in the low
to mid-90s on Monday and Tuesday. We'll be watching for record high temps in
Chattanooga. Wednesday will be partly sunny with a spotty shower chance and 92
for the high. Thursday will be mostly sunny again with a high of 93.
