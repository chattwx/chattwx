Good morning, if you enjoyed yesterday's weather, then you'll love today. It's
basically the same forecast -- sunny skies, light north wind, and cool highs in
the mid-40s. Tonight will be clear with lows in the mid to upper 20s.

Wednesday will still be nice with sunshine mixed with high thin clouds. It'll be
a little warmer in the low 50s. Thursday will have some clouds along with a
chance for a couple of isolated light showers. These showers will primarily
affect the higher elevations in TN and NC, and even possibly transition to
flurries in the evening. Friday will be slightly cooler again in the upper 40s
and partly sunny.

Our next big weather system will come in for the weekend, bringing first rain
showers on Saturday. Then, there will be the possibility of a transition to snow
late in the day Saturday into Sunday morning. It's still too early to know for
certain, but please stay flexible with your weekend plans.
