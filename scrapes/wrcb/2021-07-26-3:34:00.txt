Good Monday. It's been a pretty typical summertime day with heat, humidity, and
some scattered showers and storms. We can expect a "rinse and repeat" kind of
day Tuesday with highs in the upper 80s and low 90s and scattered afternoon
storms ending by the evening hours.

Wednesday and Thursday we will turn a corner with dangerous levels of heat and
humidity likely both days. Highs will be in the upper 90s. The heat index will
hover in the 100-105 degree range. Limit outdoor activities to the morning or
late evening to avoid the extreme heat.

Friday will be another scorcher with a high of 96, and the heat index again
climbing north of 100. We will see some scattered showers or storms in the
evening hours of Friday as a weak front slides in from the north.

The weekend will be back to a more typical pattern with highs around 90 and a
few scattered afternoon storms both Saturday and Sunday.
