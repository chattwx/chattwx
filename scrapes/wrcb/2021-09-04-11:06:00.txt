Another comfortable night is in store for the Tennessee Valley as lows fall back
into the low to mid-60s.

A weak front will approach the region late Sunday, sparking a few hit or miss
showers after 8 PM. Otherwise, skies will remain partly cloudy with highs back
in the mid-80s. A few lingering showers will be around early Monday morning with
skies gradually clearing by the afternoon hours. High temperatures will once
again top out in the mid-80s making for a fantastic Labor day!

The rest of the week will feature a mix of sun and clouds with isolated storms
Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon. A reinforcing cold front will push through late
Wednesday, gifting us with another fall preview for the end of the week!
