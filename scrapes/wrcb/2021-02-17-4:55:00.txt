Good Wednesday. We are off to a frigid start this morning with temps in the 10s
and low 20s. We will warm into the low to mid 40s with partly cloudy skies this
afternoon. This evening we will start to see a heavy wintry mix that will last
through the overnight into Thursday morning. Temps overnight will drop into the
low to mid 30s.

We have a number of WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES and WINTER STORM WARNINGS in
effect this evening through Thursday. During that time period here is what you
can expect:

RAIN: .25" to .5" on the plateau. .75" to 2" Chattanooga east into the Blue
Ridge Mtns.

SNOW: 1"-3" on the Plateau. 1"-2" in the TN Valley and Blue Ridge Mtns.

ICE: A light glaze of ice could form on elevated surfaces

Travel is not a good idea tonight or tomorrow morning. Tomorrow afternoon temps
will again be in the 40s, and we will see a few more scattered showers through
early afternoon.

Friday will be cool and dry with temps ranging from 31 to 42. We will have lots
of sunshine over the weekend, and warm into the low 60s next week!
