Today will be dry with clouds breaking up in the morning and then some high
level clouds during the day. Highs will be in the upper 40s to 50 with a
northwesterly breeze. Tonight will be mostly clear with lows in the upper 20s to
low 30s.

Saturday will start off nice with mostly sunny skies and highs near 50 closer to
noon. Then, clouds will increase, temperatures drop, and scattered rain and
wintry mix will move in from the south late afternoon into evening. Another wave
of energy from the west will bring snow and wintry mix chances Saturday night
into Sunday morning. Unfortunately, for us to be this close to the event, there
is still a lot of forecast discrepancy and low confidence on timing and exact
locations of snowfall. What we do know are higher elevations have a better
chance to receive 1"+ of snow. Please, check back for updates over the next 48
hours, especially if you have to be driving Saturday night and Sunday morning.

Sunday's daytime will have decreasing clouds with highs in the mid-40s. Monday
will be a pleasant day in the mid-50s and mostly sunny. Tuesday will be mostly
cloudy with scattered showers and mild in the upper 50s.
