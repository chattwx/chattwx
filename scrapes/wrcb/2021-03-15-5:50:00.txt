Good Monday. We have some big changes heading our way this week. Today will be
cloudy with a few sprinkles here and there and a high of 68. Our rain chances
will increase as we head through the late afternoon into the evening. Scattered
heavy rain and some rumbles of thunder will move through tonight into the
overnight. I expect about 1/4"-1/2" of rain. We are running a slight deficit for
the month and year so some rain would not be unwelcome. We can also expect windy
weather this afternoon with winds from the southwest at 15-25 mph.

Tuesday we will have a few remnant showers for drive time in the morning, but we
will mainly just be cloudy and mild with highs in the upper 60s.

Wednesday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. Wednesday afternoon we can expect heavy
rain and a 5% to 15% risk of severe storms through the afternoon into the
evening. We can expect 2+" of rain throughout the day. Wednesday's high will
reach 68.

Thursday we will start with some lingering rain in the morning, and then we will
clear out with an afternoon high of 70.

Cooler and dry weather will move in Friday through the weekend. Lows will be in
the low 40s with highs in the low 60s.
