Good Morning,

A few sprinkles this morning through 8AM for our Georgia communities expected.
It will be partly sunny today, and for many, today may break the 90Â° stretch.
Look for a high of 89 in Chattanooga.

Tomorrow (Friday) is a Storm Alert Weather Day.

If you plan on being out on the water on Friday, the best time will be in the
morning. Storms will be arriving by 1PM to 3PM west of I-75 and in Chattanooga
by 4PM-5PM. There is a Level 1 Marginal Risk for severe weather on Friday, which
means a strong to severe thunderstorm is possible. Damaging wind gusts to 60
mph, lightning, and heavy rain is possible. Storms will end by 7PM-8PM, bringing
0.50" to 1" of rainfall.

The weekend is looking fabulous! Highs will top the upper 70s for both Saturday
and Sunday - staying rain free! Enjoy.
