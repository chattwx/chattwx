Temperatures will slowly drop from the 90s to the 80s this evening under mainly
sunny skies. A few isolated storms will be possible after 8 PM especially over
the Plateau.

Rain chances will increase late tonight into Sunday as a disturbance pushes
across the Tennessee Valley. Localized heavy rain and a few rumbles of thunder
will be the primary concern. Temperatures will also be 5-7 degrees cooler on
Sunday due to the increased cloud cover.

This upcoming week will bring welcome relief from the extreme heat. It will
still be quite hot each afternoon with highs ranging from 84-89 degrees, but the
humidity will be much more tolerable. A few storms will be around each afternoon
along with plenty of sunshine for the first week of August!
