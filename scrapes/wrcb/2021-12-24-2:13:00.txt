Good Christmas Eve!! Getting the last-minute shopping runs in this evening will
be fine with mostly cloudy skies and temps in the 50s.

We won't see much of a cool down heading into Christmas morning with temps in
the mid-50s. We will climb to a toasty 70 under overcast skies Christmas
afternoon. There is a slight chance for a sprinkle and it may also be a little
breezy at times.

The warm weather will stick around for a while. We will stay in the low 70s
Sunday through Wednesday. rain and maybe a few storms will move in Wednesday and
Thursday , then clearing out by next Friday, but still fairly warm in the mid
60s.

For the latest, download the WRCB weather app. ...and MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
