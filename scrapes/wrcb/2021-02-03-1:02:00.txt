I am expecting another cold night with lows in the mid-'20s in the city and low
20's elsewhere. Thursday will be warmer with clouds increasing and highs near
50. Winds will be light and out of the south. Rain will move in for Thursday
night and lows will be in the mid to upper 30's. Friday will see showers end in
the early morning with highs near 50.

Saturday will be partly cloudy and warmer with highs in the mid-'50s. Sunday
should be sunny and mild with the mid-'50s once again. Monday will continue warm
with highs in the low 60's and partly cloudy skies.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, we will see scattered showers with highs near 60
Tuesday and in the low 50's Wednesday. Paul Barys
