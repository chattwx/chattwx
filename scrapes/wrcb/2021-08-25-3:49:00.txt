Good Wednesday. The heat was something today with highs in the mid to upper 90s.
This evening we will be dry with temps falling through the 80s. Skies will be
partly cloudy turning to mostly clear late.

Thursday will not be AS hot, but we will still likely hit about 90 with the heat
index in the mid 90s. I do expect a few showers and storms during the afternoon.

Friday through Monday will see a stable pattern emerge with highs in the mid to
upper 80s, partly cloudy skies, and only a slight chance for a stray storm. The
heat index each day will run about 90.

We are watching the tropics next Tuesday and Wednesday. Long range model data
has a tropical system just now developing in the Caribbean curving in and
bringing us some mid week rainfall.
