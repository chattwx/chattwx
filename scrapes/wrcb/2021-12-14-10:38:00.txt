Happy Tuesday, everyone! It was another cold morning across the Tennessee
Valley. Thankfully, plenty of sunshine is going to help warm our temperatures
back up into the lower 60s this afternoon.

This evening, look for mostly clear skies and falling temperatures. We will be
dropping from the 50s quickly thru the 40s. Overnight low temperatures will once
again bottom out in the 30s to low 40s.

Wednesday will feature partly sunny skies and warm afternoon temperatures.
Daytime highs will warm into the low to mid 60s.

Thursday will feature an increase in cloud cover, but we should stay mainly dry.
Highs will warm into the upper 60s with a nice southerly breeze.

Highs will climb around 70 on Friday with a mix of clouds and some sunshine.

Our next front arrives Saturday bringing a good chance for scattered showers,
and maybe a few rumbles. Severe weather is not expected with this system. We may
see a break from the rainfall Sunday, before more rain and cooler air arrives to
kickoff next week.

Have a great Tuesday!
