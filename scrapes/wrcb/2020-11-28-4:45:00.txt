Today will be the better day of the weekend for outdoor plans, so if you want to
put up those Christmas decorations, today is the day. A few areas of mist and
fog this morning will clear out for a sunny day. Highs will be in the low 60s.
Then tonight, clouds will slowly increase with lows around 40.

Sunday will begin quietly with rain arriving by about 4pm in our southwestern
counties. Highs around 60. Rain coverage will increase through Sunday evening
and especially Sunday night. A few embedded thunderstorms will be possible as
well. Total rainfall from 0.5-1", locally higher. This rain is associated with a
strong upper level system, so it'll also become windy overnight into Monday. The
other key weather point will be dropping temperatures. Once the system passes,
we'll have cold air moving in. Tracking temperatures on Monday, highs will be
around midnight, in the morning around 42, going up a couple of degrees before
falling for the rest of the day. Winter coats will be needed. Lastly, as
temperatures drop on Monday, the residual moisture will be squeezed out and some
flurries (valley) and light snow showers (higher elevations) will be possible
Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning. This will be a minor event for us a
locally, but our higher elevations of the Cumberland Plateau and eastern
mountains could see small accumulation on grassy and elevated surfaces only. 

As flurries end on Tuesday morning, the big weather focus will be the cold with
highs only near 40 and a mostly sunny sky. Wednesday morning will start in the
low to mid-20s with afternoon highs around 50 and sunny.
