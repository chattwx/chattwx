Good Tuesday. This evening we will continue with the theme of cloudy skies and a
few spotty showers. Late tonight into overnight we may get a few more
substantial areas of rain.

Wednesday we will have periods of heavy rain on and off through the day and into
Wednesday night. We will manage a high of 77. I think Thursday will be about the
same with on and off rain through the day and highs in the mid to upper 70s.

Rainfall amounts will vary wildly over the next couple of days. On the
Cumberland Plateau, we could see anywhere from 2.5" to 4.5" through Thursday. In
the TN Valley and north GA we could see as little as 1/2" all the way up to
2.5". In the Blue Ridge Mtns totals look like they may range from 1.5" to 3".

We are under a FLASH FLOOD WATCH from Wednesday morning through Thursday
morning. There is a RIVER FLOOD WARNING for Lookout Creek Wednesday through
Friday.

Friday will be cloudy, but only a 10% chance for a remnant shower. The high will
reach 78.

The weekend looks great. Expect partly cloudy skies with highs around 80.
