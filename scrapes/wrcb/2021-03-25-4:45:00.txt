Good Thursday. This is one of the highest risk days I have seen in my 13 years
in Chattanooga. It should be taken seriously, and plans made now to protect
against severe weather.

Storms this morning will produce heavy rain and lightning along with a
possibility of damaging winds. We will continue to see strong storms on and off
through the afternoon. The atmosphere will destabilize further this afternoon
into tonight which will lead to numerous severe storms in the Tennessee Valley.
There is a high risk of scattered strong tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail
developing anywhere in our area this afternoon until about 3am Friday.

A FLOOD WATCH is also in effect for all counties as we are expecting some areas
to get 2"-4" of rain.

Friday will clear and be sunny in the afternoon with a high of 75.

More strong storms will move through Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning.
