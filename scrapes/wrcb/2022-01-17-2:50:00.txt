Good morning, after an eventful weather day yesterday, today will be quieter.
However, you will still need to use caution this morning. Please be careful
driving in areas that received snow and slush on Sunday, especially in the
higher elevations that picked up a few inches. Patchy black ice will also be
possible across the area on untreated/sheltered secondary roads, bridges,
overpasses, and elevated surfaces such as your deck or steps at home. Roads will
generally be below freezing through 9am with big improvements for most of the
area from 9-10am. Higher elevation roads will continue to be below or near
freezing through noon, particularly along the plateau. There will be another
clipper of flurries from about 5am to noon to sweep across the area â€“ again
affecting the higher elevations, mostly in Tennessee.

Monday afternoon will be mostly cloudy with cold highs in the mid-30s and wind
at 10-15mph, gusts at 20. Clouds will partially clear for the evening in the low
30s, and overnight will be very cold in the low to mid-20s with a few clouds.
Tuesday will be mostly sunny with "warmer" highs in the mid-40s. Wednesday will
begin dry with rain in the afternoon into the night associated with a cold
front. As colder air arrives, a transition to a few light snow showers along
area ridgelines will be possible on Thursday morning. The rest of Thursday will
be cooler again in the 30s to 40. Friday will drop even more with a high of only
35 and scattered light snow showers, especially east of I-75.
