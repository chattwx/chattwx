It will be a splendid afternoon with broken clouds and calm winds, with
temperatures reaching the mid 60s. The record high for February 9th is 76° from
2001. While it won't likely come close to the record high, still ~10 degrees
above normal for early February near 63-64 today. Feeling like March out there.

The rain chance increases during the day Thursday. It will get soggy with
rainfall amounts of 1" to 2" by Thursday night. There is a general thunderstorm
threat at this time. It looks to be in the afternoon and early evening.

As the weekend draws near, with spring-like pattern comes to an end, too. Arctic
air will reach the Tennessee Valley sometime Sunday. There is a chance by Sunday
morning, although I think the best bet will be Sunday night-early Monday
morning. The frigid air is only with us about 24-36 hours with lows near 19° in
the city and mid to upper teens in the higher elevations. Those along the
Cumberland Plateau may get lows into the single digits. For those with outdoor
animals, and many of our nurseries- plan on bringing them in Sunday night,
possibly Monday night at this time.
