the mid to upper 40s. Patchy fog may develop again tomorrow morning.

Sunday will be mostly cloudy to overcast with highs near 68. The first part of
the day will be dry for your outdoor plans, so enjoy. There's a very low chance
for a mid-afternoon sprinkle. However, from about 5pm/4pm CT to 1am ET, a band
of showers will move across the area from west to east. Total rainfall should be

Tuesday will have some high, thin clouds and highs near 60 again. Wednesday will
be rainy, highs near 64. Showers will start around 10am and continue throughout

of now, the threat of severe weather is low. Thanksgiving will have a mix of sun
and clouds with highs near 66, and the week will end with a partly sunny sky and
