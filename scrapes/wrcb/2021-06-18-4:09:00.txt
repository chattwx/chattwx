Enjoy the pleasant temperatures while they last this Friday morning because by
lunch, it'll be in the 80s. Then, afternoon highs will reach the low 90s for
most locations. Expect a sunny sky with a few afternoon clouds and light wind
from the south. It'll also be a little bit more humid today. Clouds will
increase tonight with lows from 65-70.

Our weekend weather depends on the track of "Potential Tropical Cyclone Three."
It's likely to form into a subtropical or tropical storm later today. Our area
is within the forecast cone, but the system will be significantly offset with
the heaviest rain on the east side of the center, which means our north Georgia
communities are the ones on the northern edge for widespread rain (less in TN).

As of now, Saturday will have increasing clouds with highs in the mid-80s.
Scattered hit and miss PM showers/storms across the area. Any consistent rain
should only clip our far southern counties Saturday night into Sunday. Rain will
then increase on Sunday as the tropical system swings by. However, if you're
north and west of Chattanooga, you have better chances of limited or no rainfall
for Father's Day. Highs in the low 80s.

We'll then have additional rain and storms Monday into Tuesday associated with a
cold front. During this time, rain will be more likely for everyone.
