Good Monday. We will be cloudy and muggy with temps around 80 this evening. We
may see a few late-day showers/storms east of Chattanooga early evening and then
a few more spotty storms popping up late tonight. I don't expect anything
severe, but we will keep a close eye on it.

Tuesday we may get a couple of showers in the morning, and then a few storms in
the afternoon. It will be another and humid day with temps from 70 to 86
degrees.

Wednesday and Thursday will be dominated by mugginess. Highs will reach 90 with
heat index values in the mid-90s. I expect very little (if any) rain either day.

Friday through the weekend the summer pattern returns with highs in the upper
80s, lots of humidity, and a few storms popping up each afternoon.
