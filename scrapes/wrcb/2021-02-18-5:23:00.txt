Good Thursday. With the rain / wintry weather moving out this morning we are
still left with a WINTER STORM WARNING until 9am central for the Cumberland
Plateau.

Road temps on the plateau are in the upper 20s, and patchy areas of ice are
likely on untreated surfaces.

All across our area we may have some areas with slush and ice on elevated
surfaces like porches, trees, and power lines through the morning.

We also have a FLASH FLOOD WATCH through Friday morning for the creeks and
streams in our north Georgia counties.

This afternoon we will be cool and cloudy with the highs reaching the low to mid
40s. A few more showers may pop up east of Chattanooga this afternoon.

Friday skies will clear out and we will be cool with temps ranging from 30 to
47.

The weekend will sport cold mornings in the mid to upper 20s with highs climbing
to 47 Saturday and 55 Sunday.

I expect more rain showers Monday.
