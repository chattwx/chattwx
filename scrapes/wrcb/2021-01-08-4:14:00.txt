Good Friday! After a wet, wintry mix this morning we will have a cold and cloudy
afternoon. Highs will only make it to the upper 30s and low 40s.

The weekend will be cold and dry with lows in the upper 20s both Saturday and
Sunday morning. The highs will be in the low 40s Saturday. We will make it to 49
Sunday.

Monday we will have temps ranging from 32 in the morning to 46 in the afternoon.
Another low will bring in a few scattered rain showers during the evening. That
MAY linger into early Tuesday morning in which it would allow for a light wintry
mix.

Most of Tuesday through the rest of the week will be dry with cold mornings in
the 20s and 30s. Afternoon highs, however, will make it into the low to mid 50s.
