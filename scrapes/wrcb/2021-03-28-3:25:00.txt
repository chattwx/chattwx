After a busy past 2 days in weather, we all get to breathe and enjoy now. Clouds
will slowly clear this evening, lingering the longest over our southern counties
in Georgia and Alabama. Tonight is March's full Worm Moon. It rises at 8:06pm ET
and sets at 8:18am Monday morning. Later tonight will be mostly clear for a
great view of the Moon. Lows will be in the mid to upper 30s.

Monday will be beautiful -- sunny skies, only a few stray clouds, and highs in
the mid-60s. Wind will be light from the northeast. Tuesday will be sunny in the
morning and partly sunny in the afternoon with highs in the low 70s. Then, our
next rain chances will start Tuesday night with isolated showers. Wednesday will
be rainy, especially in the morning. Highs around 65. Thursday will be cooler as
we begin the month of April. Highs near 54 with a mostly sunny sky. Friday
morning will be cold with temperatures at or below freezing, so pull out those
coats again. Friday will be sunny with highs in the mid-50s. Saturday will warm
slight to the mid-60s, and then, about 70 for Sunday.
