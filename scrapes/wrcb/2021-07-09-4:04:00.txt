Good Friday! It should be a much quieter evening after many in the TN Valley saw
more than 2" of rain this morning and afternoon. With that said, a stray shower
or storm could pop up, but they will be few and far between. It will be humid
this evening with temps dropping from the 80s into the 70s.

Saturday will start cloudy and muggy with a number of scattered storms during
the afternoon and early evening. Highs will be in the mid to upper 80s.

A slow-moving front will bring a number of scattered storms in through the day
Sunday and Monday. Highs both days will be in the mid 80s.

Tuesday through Thursday will stay humid with highs in the mid to upper 80s, and
a few pop-up storms each afternoon. Rain will be a little more likely by next
Friday.
