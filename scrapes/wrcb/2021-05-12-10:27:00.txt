Today's highs will be well below the normal of 80 for May 12th. Temperatures
will stay in the 50s for many locations with a few spots, like Chattanooga,
reaching the low 60s. Clouds are clearing from west to east in a line oriented
almost along I-75 in TN to I-59 in GA/AL. Those who get more sunshine will have
the slightly warmer temps. Overall, we'll call the afternoon partly sunny with
wind from the NE at 10mph. Tonight will be partly cloudy with lows in the
mid-40s.

Thursday will begin mostly sunny in the morning with more clouds for the
afternoon. There's a stray sprinkle chance (10%), primarily for the higher
elevations. Otherwise, it'll be a dry day with highs in the upper 60s. Friday
will be nice with a mostly sunny sky and highs in the low 70s. Saturday will
warm up to 78 with more sun than clouds - great for outdoor plans. Sunday will
have increasing clouds with highs around 80.

The warmer air will stick around for the start of next week with highs in the
upper 70s to low 80s. A couple of isolated showers possible on Monday with
scattered showers on Tuesday on Wednesday.
