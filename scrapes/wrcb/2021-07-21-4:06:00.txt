Today, we start our climb back up to hotter, seasonable July temperatures.
Wednesday will begin with a little bit of patchy fog, a few isolated showers,
and mostly cloudy skies. Clouds will decrease during the day, allowing for
sunshine and that summertime heat. Highs will be in the upper 80s with the heat
index in the low 90s. Rain chances will be lower today, but not zero. We'll have
isolated showers, primarily in Georgia, Alabama, southern Hamilton, and Marion
Counties.

Thursday will be mostly sunny with highs around 90. Friday and Saturday will
both have lots of sunshine with highs in the low 90s. All three days will have
very minimal rain chances at 10%. Sunday and Monday will be very hot and muggy.
True air temperatures near 94 with heat indices around 100. Both days will have
a mix of sun and clouds with afternoon and evening pop-up showers and storms.
