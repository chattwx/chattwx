Another cool start to the day with areas of river valley fog developing. Any
foggy spots will last through about 9am, and then once again, it's about
sunshine for Tuesday. Plentiful sun and blue sky at noon in the low to mid-60s.
A few clouds in the afternoon with highs from 70-75, followed by a thin layer of
clouds moving in from the west for the evening hours. Temperatures will drop
through the 60s during the evening with overnight lows in the mid to upper 40s.

Wednesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the mid-70s. Then, our active
weather day of the work-week will bring scattered showers and a few storms on
Thursday along with more clouds. It'll still be warm with highs in the mid-70s.
Friday may have a couple of residual showers early, especially to the east.
It'll be a partly sunny day with highs in the low 70s. Saturday and Sunday both
look to be warm in the mid-70s with a couple of isolated showers. Rain chances
are low both days, but as of now, the greatest time should be Sunday afternoon
north of Chattanooga.
