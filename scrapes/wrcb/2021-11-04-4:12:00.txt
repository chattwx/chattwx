Thursday will begin with scattered light showers and drizzle through the morning
hours. It will wrap up by noon with only a stray sprinkle in the higher
elevations in the afternoon. Rainfall will be very light for those locations
that receive it at a Trace to 0.1". It'll remain cloudy and cool today with
highs around 50. Clouds will slowly break in the evening, and tonight will be
partly cloudy with lows in the low to mid 30s. Frost Advisories have been issued
for our TN counties, Cherokee County in NC, and Jackson County in AL.
Additionally, Bledsoe, Sequatchie, SE Monroe, Grundy, and Van Buren Counties are
under Freeze Warnings. Please, protect your plants and pets tonight.

Friday will be partly cloudy with highs in the mid-50s. Saturday morning will be
another cold start in the 30s with afternoon highs around 60. Sunday will warm
to near 65. Both weekend days will have abundant sunshine -- great for Head of
the Hooch and leaf peeping. Sunny skies will continue on Monday with highs in
the upper 60s, and then mostly sunny and 70 on Tuesday.
