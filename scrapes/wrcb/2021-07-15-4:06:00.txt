Thursday morning will be calm and quiet for most locations with a clear sky.
However, dense river valley fog has developed, particularly in the Sequatchie
Valley, the TN River Valley in Alabama, and the streams in our eastern mountain
counties. Please, use caution as fog will last until about 9am. Otherwise, the
big weather story for today will be the heat. Highs today will be in the upper
80s to low 90s. The humidity will have it feeling like the mid-90s. We'll have a
mostly sunny sky and only a small isolated shower chance. Tonight will be mostly
clear with lows from 65-70.

Friday will begin sunny, becoming partly cloudy for the afternoon. It'll still
be hot in the upper 80s to 90 with scattered showers/storms. Then, Saturday will
begin quietly, but a cold front will approach our area later in the day with
showers and storms firing up. The front will stall out producing likely rain and
storm chances on both Sunday and Monday, too. Locally heavy rainfall may cause
flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas all 3 days, and we'll need to keep
an eye on Saturday PM for damaging wind gusts in stronger storms.
