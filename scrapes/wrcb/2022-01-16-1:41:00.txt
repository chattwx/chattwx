Periods of snow will continue for much of the area through this evening before
gradually tapering off tonight. Some areas could receive an additional 1-3"
especially in the higher elevations and along the Plateau. A few locations will
receive very little snowfall due to lingering warm air.

Roadways will continue to deteriorate as temperatures drop below freezing this
evening. Snow-covered roads and black ice will make travel dangerous through
Monday morning. Try to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary.

Additional Snowfall Forecast:

Cumberland Plateau: 2-4"

Eastern mountains: 1-3" with higher amounts for elevations above 4,000 ft

Valley/North Georgia: Dusting-2" (Localized amounts of 3")

NE Alabama: 1-3"

Metro Mountains: 1-3"

Timing of Snow Ending:

Cumberland Plateau: 8-10 PM Sunday

Eastern mountains: 10 PM- Midnight

Valley/North Georgia: 9-10 PM Sunday

A bulk of the moisture will move out tonight, with just a few lingering flurries
around Monday morning.
