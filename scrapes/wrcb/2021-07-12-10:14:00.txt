TODAY:

We are under a Level 1 Marginal risk for severe weather this afternoon and
evening.

A few showers expected along the Cumberland Plateau about 12PM-2PM.

There will be storms developing west by 3PM-4PM, increasing in our far west DMA,
Jackson, DeKalb, Franklin, by 4PM-5PM.

Storms look to increase this evening, bringing isolated wind damage. Similar to
these last few days, I suspect Significant Weather Advisories, with wind gusts
40-50mph.

MUGGY PATTERN

The "Wear the Air" trend will continue ALL week. I don't see a break in the
humidity for the next 7 - really for the next 14 days. The muggy air will take
us into August.

This means - summer time showers are with us each day over the next week, too.
Rainfall totals of 1.2" to 1.5" expected for the next week.

Stay cool and hydrated! You can track storms using the WRCB Weather App.
