T.G.I.F, everyone! It's going to be another mostly cloudy and cool day across
the region. High temperatures will be a bit warmer than Thursday, with highs
climbing into the 50s. Tonight, mostly cloudy skies early, then skies will
become mostly clear overnight. Some patchy dense fog will likely develop again,
especially in the river valleys overnight into early Saturday morning.
Otherwise, look for another cold night with lows falling into the 30s.

Saturday will feature some early morning fog, otherwise mostly sunny skies will
take over for the afternoon hours. Highs will warm into the upper 50s to lower
60s. Clear skies and calm winds will likely set us up for our coldest night area
wide Saturday night. Overnight lows will fall into the low to mid 30s. Frost and
freeze conditions will again be possible. Sunday will feature wall-to-wall
sunshine, with highs back into the mid 60s.

Next week starts off great! We're looking at a nice warming trend with highs
near 70, and morning lows in the 40s. Clouds will be on the increase by the
middle of next week, with our next rain maker arriving late next week. Showers &
storms will be possible Thursday night into Friday, followed by another
significant blast of cold air. At least it's beginning to feel a lot more like
the holidays!

Have a great rest of your Friday!
