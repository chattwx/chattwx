We will be a bit more humid heading into Thursday and Friday. Our mornings will
also be a little warmer. We will start at 67 Thursday morning, and climb to 87
with partly cloudy skies and a VERY slight chance for a stray afternoon shower.
Friday will be about the same though the skies will be sunny through the day.

The weekend will be a muggy one with dew points around 70 and highs in the upper
80s. If you want to feel better about it, keep in mind the heat wave settling in
out west is bringing record-breaking temps to them this weekend. The high in
Boise, Idaho Sunday is supposed to reach about 102! We will be rain-free
Saturday save a random sprinkle. Sunday we will have more widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms.

Next week I don't expect anything earth-shattering. Very "June" weather. We will
have muggy highs in the upper 80s with a few showers and storms sprinkled in
here and there.
