It's a cold beginning to your Sunday in the 30s, so grab your coat if you're
heading out early. Low level clouds are moving in from the southeast this
morning and will make for a partly sunny day. Highs will be seasonable for this
point in March around 65 with a light ENE breeze. Even though we'll have more
clouds today than yesterday, it'll still be a great day to enjoy outdoors.

Tonight will be partly cloudy and not as cold with lows in the low 40s. Monday
will be warm around 70 and mostly sunny with times of clouds. Tuesday will be
mostly cloudy with a spotty shower chance in the morning and then scattered
showers/storms for the evening and night. Highs will be in the mid-60s.
Scattered showers continue on Wednesday in the upper 60s. More widespread rain
will develop on Thursday, along with some stronger storms. This activity will
continue at night into Friday morning. Another 1-3" of rain will be possible
from Tuesday through Friday morning, so we'll have to watch for flooding again.
Clouds will clear later on Friday with highs around 70. Then, Saturday should be
mostly sunny and warm in the low 70s.
