T.G.I.F, everyone! It's been another cloudy, chilly, and damp day across the
Tennessee Valley. We will likely see periods of showers rotating through the
area this evening, slowly fading through the night. Temperatures will hover in
the upper 40s to low 50s.

Saturday will feature cloudy skies, with more showers pivoting through the area.
The day will not be a complete wash out, but expect passing showers from time to
time. Highs once again will only be in the 50s.

Big changes arrive Sunday, as our system begins to lift away from the area. Look
for clearing skies and warmer temperatures. Highs should top out in the 60s.

The nice weather will stick around through midweek, with a mix of clouds and
sunshine and comfortable temps. Our next weather maker approaches late next week
bringing our next chance of rain, and reinforcing shot of cooler air.

Have a great weekend!
