Temperatures will rise back into the lower-90s this afternoon as skies
transition from mostly cloudy to partly cloudy. Another round of scattered
showers and storms will break out between 1-8 PM this afternoon and evening.
Once again, there will be the potential for a few strong to severe storms. Those
who remain dry with limited cloud cover will be dealing with heat index values
close to 100 degrees.

More scattered showers and storms will develop Friday ahead of an approaching
cold front. The stormy pattern will continue into the weekend as the cold front
stalls out over our area. A few severe storms with damaging wind gusts and small
hail will be possible each afternoon. Temperatures will remain hot through
Sunday with highs ranging from 87-92 degrees.

Rain chances will linger into next week, but temperatures will be slightly
cooler. Depending on the path of Tropical Depression Fred, we could be dealing
with higher rain chances by the middle of the week.
