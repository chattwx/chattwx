Happy Thursday! Temperatures will top out in the mid to upper-80s by this
afternoon. Skies will range from mostly sunny to partly cloudy with only a small
chance of a pop-up shower east of I-75. Skies will remain mainly clear tonight
as lows drop back into the mid-60s.

Cloud cover will be on the increase for your Friday. A few pop-up afternoon
storms will be possible, but overall most locations will remain dry on Friday
with highs ranging from 85-89 degrees.

Saturday will be our best chance of rain over the next several days. The highest
coverage of showers and storms will be during the afternoon hours. Highs will
range from 86-90 degrees.

The heat and humidity will return to August standards Sunday through Wednesday
as highs top out in the low to mid-90s each afternoon. Rain chances will be low
each day, but a few afternoon pop-up showers or storms cannot be ruled out.
