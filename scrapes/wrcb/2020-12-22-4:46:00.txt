Good Tuesday. If you have to get out and physically shop for that last-minute
gift today and tomorrow will be the days to get it done. We will be sunny and
mild with a high of 59 today. Skies will be clear starting out Wednesday with
the high reaching the upper 50s. Clouds will build in late with spotty rain
showers Wednesday evening.

We will see heavy rain (1"-1.5") moving through overnight Wednesday through
Thursday morning. If you are traveling you will face primarily rain, but there
will be some wintry mix on the plateau as colder air begins to filter in after
6am. The heavy rain will move off to the east by late morning, but as temps drop
into the 30s during the afternoon the cold air will mix with residual moisture
to produce light snow showers on and off through the afternoon and early evening
hours. While we may get 1" to 2" in the higher elevations, we could also see
flurries to a light dusting in the valley as well.

Christmas will be sunny, cold, and breezy. Temps will range from the low 20s in
the morning to the low to mid-30s in the afternoon.

The weekend will have cold mornings in the 20s with highs in the upper 40s and
low 50s. We will be dry through the weekend.
