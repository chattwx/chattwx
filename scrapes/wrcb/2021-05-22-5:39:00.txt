The heat we've been talking about all week is finally upon us. Today won't be
too bad with highs for most ranging from 85-89 with wind from the northeast in
the afternoon. Sunday will be hotter. Highs will be in the upper 80s to low 90s
- 92 in Chattanooga. Both days will have a mix of sun and clouds, primarily high
thin clouds with scattered lower level clouds developing with the heating of the
day in the afternoon.

It'll get even hotter next week. Monday and Tuesday will be near 94, then 93 on
Wednesday, and 92 on Thursday. There will be a few sporadic chances for an
afternoon shower, but overall it'll be a dry week. The next best chance for
scattered showers looks to be next Saturday.

Since this is our first heat wave of 2021, there are a few things to
consider/remember.

1. Never leave kids or pets in your car.

2. Stay hydrated, take breaks in the shade or A/C, limit strenuous activities.

3. As the ridge of high pressure continues to build over our area and the heat
cranks up, air quality decreases. Air quality will be moderate both Saturday and
Sunday.

4. Water your plants with no significant rain this week.
