Good Saturday morning, today is a Storm Alert Weather Day as we have Winter
Weather Advisories in place for Grundy Co in TN and Cherokee Co in NC with 1-2"
of snow possible. Expect snow showers this morning until about 1pm. Once again,
this is a higher elevation event. Most Higher Elevations: more likely dusting to
0.5", some up to 1". Valleys: flurries if anything at all with little to no
accumulation. For most, ground temperatures will be too warm. Only minor impacts
to mountain roads, bridges, and overpasses. The rest of Saturday will be cool
with highs in the upper 30s to low 40s with a few spitting snowflakes.

Tonight will be mostly cloudy with lows in the upper 20s to low 30s. Sunday will
be the nicer day of the weekend from mostly cloudy to partly sunny and highs
near 48. Another wave of light snow and flurries will be possible Sunday night
into Monday morning, but as this time, it only looks like a dusting in the
higher elevations.

Monday will have a mix of sun and clouds and highs in the mid-40s. Tuesday and
Wednesday will have more sun than clouds with highs in the low 50s. Rain showers
return on Thursday with falling temperatures on Friday and possible transition
to snow late.
