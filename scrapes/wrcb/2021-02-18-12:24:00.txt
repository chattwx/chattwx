We will have to put up with colder than normal temperatures for the next 48
hours, but I do see warmer air heading our way for next week. Friday will be
mostly cloudy to partly cloudy by afternoon with highs only in the low 40's
along with a north wind to 15 mph. Friday night will be very cold with lows in
the low 20's, but in the teens away from the city. Saturday will be a bit warmer
with the upper 40's expected. Sunshine will be abundant making it feel warmer.
Sunday continues sunny with highs in the upper 50's.

Monday will see another round of rain likely and highs in the mid 50's again.
Tuesday and Wednesday will see the sun return with highs near 60 Tuesday and in
the mid 60's Wednesday. More rain showers will develop on Thursday with highs in
the mid-'50s. Paul Barys
