Happy Monday, everyone! It's a sunny, but chilly afternoon across the area.
Temperatures will actually begin to fall late this afternoon from the 50s into
the 40s. This evening, temps start off near 40, but will quickly drop thru the
30s. Make sure you dress in layers if you're going to be out and about during
the evening hours. Clear skies and light winds overnight will likely set us up
for our coldest night so far this season. Overnight lows are expected to drop
into the 20s area wide. A Hard Freeze will be likely with many areas below
freezing for at least 6-10 hours.

Tuesday will feature sunny skies and but a chilly day. High temperatures will
only rebound into the upper 40s to near 50. Partly cloudy and cool weather is
expected for our Wednesday, with highs only in the mid 50s.

Thanksgiving Day right now looks mostly dry with increasing clouds. A front
approaches the area by Thursday evening leading to our next chance for a few
showers. Right now, this system does not look too impressive, but a few showers
will be possible during the evening. Highs on Thursday will be in the upper 50s
to near 60.

Our next blast of cooler air arrives Friday into the weekend. Look for clearing
skies, plenty of sunshine but highs only in the 40s and 50s and lows back below
freezing.

Bundle up this afternoon!
