Happy Tuesday, everyone! It was another cold start to the day, but sunshine and
a light southerly wind will help commence a warming trend, beginning this
afternoon! Look for plenty of sunshine & mild temps. Highs will warm into the
lower 60s.

Tonight, clear skies and light winds will allow overnight lows to once again
visit the 30s by early morning.

Things will remain on the sunny & dry side through most of this upcoming week.
We are running a 3" + rainfall deficit this month, so we could use some rain
around these parts.

Temperatures will begin a nice warming trend each day, with high temps peaking
in the upper 60s to around 70 by late-week!

Our next weather maker right now is showing up around next weekend into the
following week. This system could bring us some needed rainfall and maybe some
cooler weather back to the area. Of course, we will keep you updated on this
system as it's still 6-8 days away!

Have a great rest of your Tuesday!
