Good Morning,

It will be cooler this afternoon with highs near 50 as clouds increase today.

Expect more cloud cover tonight with lows near 30-32.

A wintry mix will begin Thursday evening and continue into Friday. Precipitation
on Friday evening looks to transition to all snow. As temperatures drop on
Friday night to the 20s, minor snow accumulation will be possible in the valley,
and in the higher elevations. Snow amounts of 1" to 2" east of I-75 is possible
in Polk, Cherokee, Fannin and Gilmer counties. Those on the Cumberland Plateau
could get 1" to 2" of snow, with some areas reaching 3" by Saturday morning.

I have added in a small snow chance for Saturday morning before 9AM. Please be
advised there will likely be slick roads on Saturday morning, too.

TODAY:

12PM: Increasing Clouds, 42

3PM: M. Cloudy, 49

6PM: M. Cloudy, 43
