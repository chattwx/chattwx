Good Monday. This evening we may see a few pop-up storms, but most will be
cloudy and humid with temps in the upper 70s.

Tuesday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. Tuesday morning early we will start to see
rain bands from Fred moving in from the south. It will rain heavily all day,
however rainfall amounts will vary wildly with the heaviest amounts being east
of I-75. Flooding in our eastern counties is likely Tuesday. Here is a breakdown
of forecast rainfall amounts.

Cumberland Plateau / NE Alabama... Up to 1"

TN Valley west of I-75... 2"-4"

TN Valley along and east of I-75... 2"-4"

Blue Ridge Mtns... 3"-5"+ (isolated spots may get up to 7")

We will dry out Tuesday night into Wednesday with a muggy high Wednesday of 90.
Thursday through the weekend we ill stay very humid with highs in the upper 80s
and a few showers or storms possible each day.

Tropical Depression Grace is currently bringing heavy rain and possibly
mudslides to the same areas of Haiti ravaged by the earthquake.
