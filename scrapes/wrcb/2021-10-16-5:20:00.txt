Although the first day of fall is well behind us, this weekend will be the first
burst of consecutive days feeling like fall outside. Enjoy the cool, crisp fall
air!

The strong cold front will pass across our area this morning through about 8am
with scattered showers lasting until about 9am for Cherokee County. Once the
front passes your location, expect temperatures to drop and wind to shift out of
the northwest. For the rest of the morning, clouds will gradually clear. This
afternoon will be sunny, and temperatures will only rebound to the low to
mid-60s. Wind will be brisk from the NNW at 10-15mph, gusts at 20-25mph.
Halloween and fall decorations may be blown around, and humidity will be
dropping. If you have a fire today, please use extra caution due to the wind and
check with local burn permitting authorities.

Tonight skies will be clear and lows will be chilly in the low to mid-40s with a
couple of locations in the upper 30s. Sunday will be sunny with highs in the
mid-60s. Monday will begin in the 40s again, then up to the upper 60s to 70 for
the afternoon. Tuesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 70s. Wednesday
partly cloudy and a bit warmer near 75.
