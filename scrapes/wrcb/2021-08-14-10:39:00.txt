Heavy storms dropped 1-3" of rainfall across our eastern communities this
evening. We are still dealing with scattered showers and storms, but it looks
like most of the activity will die down by 2 AM. The rest of the night will
feature partly cloudy skies with lows ranging from 67-72 degrees.

A front will stall out across the area Sunday, leading to higher rain chances
across the Tennessee Valley. The severe threat will be low, but a few strong
storms will be possible. High temperatures will top out in the mid to upper-80s.

The forecast for Monday and Tuesday looks to be quite stormy as Tropical
Depression Fred moves inland. The latest track puts Fred to our west late Monday
into Tuesday. Periods of rain and thunderstorms will be likely with the
potential for isolated areas of flash flooding. Rainfall amounts will range from
1-2" with locally higher amounts, especially across the higher elevations.
Temperatures will top out in the low to mid-80s.
