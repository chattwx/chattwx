Good morning, winter coats and clothes will be needed this morning with the day
starting off below freezing. The coldest air in the teens has settled over
portions of the Cumberland Plateau. Refreezing of leftover snow from yesterday
and patchy black ice will be possible this morning, primarily on secondary roads
sheltered by trees where the wind may not have evaporated the water. Also, if
your home tends to have water puddle on the outdoor steps, be careful walking on
them due to possible ice patches. Once we get through the morning hours, the
rest of today won't be quite as chilly as yesterday. It'll be mostly sunny with
highs in the mid to upper 40s.

Tonight will be partly cloudy with lows on either side of the freezing 32
degrees. Then, Wednesday will have more clouds and will reach the low 50s.
Thursday will be our next chance for rain. We're keeping an eye on the north to
south path of the system. If it drops a little farther south, a rain turning to
winter mix will be possible. If its path is north, then we'll primarily
experience rain with only a little backside wintry mix. Right now, at this the
plateau counties over to Rhea look to have a chance for mix and flurries. It
won't be the big snow for these areas from yesterday morning.

No matter where you live, a strong blast of cold air is anticipated with likely
the coldest temperatures of the season on Friday morning. Many locations will
begin the day in the teens - low 20s in Chattanooga. Friday's highs topping out
in the mid-30s. For the latest, download the WRCB weather app.
