Temperatures will slowly fall into the low to mid-60s tonight under mostly clear
skies. A few areas of fog will be around after 3 AM but should not cause much of
an issue for your Monday morning commute.

Above-average temperatures will continue Monday through Thursday as highs range
from 79-84 degrees each afternoon. Rain chances will be low through the first
part of the week, but a weak cold front could bring a few showers to the
Tennessee Valley on Tuesday. Otherwise, skies will range from mostly sunny to
partly cloudy each day.

A strong cold front will trek across the area late Friday into Saturday,
sparking scattered showers. Rainfall amounts look to remain light, but a major
blast of fall air will likely move in during the day on Saturday. Highs will
drop back into the lower-70s with overnight lows returning to the upper-40s.
Sweater weather officially returns next weekend!
