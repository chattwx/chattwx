Monday morning begins with below freezing temperatures and many locations in the
20s, so certainly grab the winter coat before you head out the door. We'll have
a warm up this afternoon with highs above normal near 58 under a sunny sky. This
warming trend will continue for the rest of work week. Tonight will be mostly
clear with areas of patchy fog developing after about 3am. Lows will be from
28-35 for most.

Tuesday will be milder hitting the low 60s with a mostly sunny sky. Wednesday
will bump up again to 64 with a mostly sunny to partly cloudy sky. Thursday will
be partly sunny with clouds especially increasing late in the day along with a
few isolated showers. Highs on Thursday in the mid-60s. Friday will be mostly
cloudy with scattered showers, but it'll also be our warmest day of the week in
the upper 60s to 70. The scattered shower chances should continue on Saturday
and Sunday as well. Highs in the mid-60s Saturday, down to the mid-50s on
Sunday.
