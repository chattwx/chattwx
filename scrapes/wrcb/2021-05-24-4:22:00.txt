There will very few changes in the weather pattern for the next few days. We are
getting drier and drier, and this may be of a big concern later through this
summer unless the pattern changes. Highs will be near 90 for both Tuesday and
Wednesday.

By Thursday and Friday, some of the weather charts are indicating a slice of
moisture that has been trapped out to the west of us will move our way. With dry
air that has been sitting over us for so long, I am inclined to believe that
this will be minimal in helping us rainwise. But it is a chance at least.

Highs should be near 90 again on Thursday and Friday with mid-'80s expected
Saturday through Monday. Paul Barys
