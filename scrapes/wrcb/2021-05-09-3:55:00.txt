Pockets of showers have already started this afternoon along with the ongoing
windy conditions. Heading into Mother's Day evening, we continue to Storm Alert
for a gusty line of broken showers and storms from about 5pm to 10pm EDT. The
system will be moving from southwest to northeast, impacting our western
counties first. 

All counties are under a low-end Level 1 Marginal risk for an isolated severe
storm possible. The primary threat will be damaging wind gusts, which may bring
down trees/tree limbs like we experienced twice this past week. Everyone needs
to be aware of that hazard, but especially if you have Mother's Day dinner plans
outside, due to the rain and wind you probably should consider moving them
indoors. 

Pockets of rain/storms will continue after the 10pm time listed above, but the
severe threat should be done by then. Showers will fade out during the early
morning hours of Monday with lows in the upper 50s to low 60s. Monday will be
mostly cloudy with some additional light scattered showers (40%) and cooler with
highs around 70. Tuesday will have a mix of sun and clouds, more clouds if
you're south of Chattanooga, and an isolated shower chance. Then great coverage
of showers will move in Tuesday night into Wednesday, primarily affecting
locations in Georgia and Alabama.
