Happy Thursday, everyone! We have a few extra clouds around the area today, but
a south wind will still help to warm our temperatures up into the mid to upper
60s this afternoon. This evening, a weak front will approach the area from the
north giving our northern communities a chance for a few scattered showers to
roll through. Otherwise, look for increasing clouds and mild temperatures.
Overnight lows will only drop into the 50s for most by early Friday morning.

Friday, the frontal boundary will lift back to the north, meaning the rain
chances quickly shift to our north, but also allows for a stronger push of
southerly winds. This means high temperatures will probably flirt with, if not
pass the 70° mark. The only issue for our Friday will be the mostly cloudy
skies, which will help limit the sunshine.

Saturday, the front to our north gets a stronger push south, along with some
extra moisture. This will likely lead to a good chance for scattered showers &
maybe a few rumbles. Severe weather is NOT expected with this, but scattered
downpours and some lightning will be possible through the daytime hours.

The front clears the area by Sunday with gradual clearing. Highs will be much
cooler, struggling to reach 50° again.

Next week will start off chilly with near-normal to below normal high
temperatures along with frost and freezing mornings. An area of low pressure is
currently being projected to travel just south of us, leading to a drier
forecast. Still, the system will be close enough for us to keep an on the
trends. Overall next week looks quiet and seasonable with highs in the 50s and
lows in the 30s.

Have a great Thursday!
