Happy Tuesday, everyone! It's going to be a more pleasant day around the area
with mostly sunny skies, and warmer temperatures. Highs will be in the mid to
upper 40s.

Clouds will be on the increase Wednesday, with our next cold front arriving
Wednesday afternoon & evening. Showers, with some brief local heavy rain will be
likely Wednesday evening. Late Wednesday night into early Thursday could feature
a brief mountain wintry mix, but overall impacts appear to be very minor.

Another shot of very cold air arrives by the late-week across the area with
highs struggling to climb above freezing. The front will stall to our south on
Friday, with another wave of low pressure moving up along the front. Depending
on how far north this system gets, another round of wintry weather could move
into the area. Stay tuned!

Have a great rest of your Tuesday!
