It will be a warm afternoon under a partly cloudy sky. Highs once again, will be
~10 to 12 above normal in the low 80s!

Pollen is high, but considerably better - in the 1900s today. Tree pollen should
take a dip this week, thanks to rain Wednesday and cooler temperatures for the
end of the week.

Look for a stray shower from 5PM to 10PM north of Chattanooga this evening.
Rainfall will amount to only a trace to only a few hundredths.

Wednesday - more widely scattered showers return. Look for rain increasing after
1PM tomorrow. Over the last day - computer model data has shown 0.50" to 1" is
looking likely through this time.

TODAY:

12PM: P. Cloudy, 72

3PM: P. Cloudy, stray shower north, 82

6PM: Isolated showers north, 79
