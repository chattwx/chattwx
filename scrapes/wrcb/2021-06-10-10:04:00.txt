It is another dreary, muggy day across the Tennessee Valley. High temperatures
will range from 78-84 degrees this afternoon. Scattered showers and a few
thunderstorms will develop late in the day. The highest coverage will likely be
west of I-59 and in our higher elevations. Localized flooding will be possible
with some of the heavier showers and storms.

Friday will feature the same weather pattern with temperatures a few degrees
warmer.

Rain coverage will be spotty this weekend with most of us remaining dry. The
heat is going to crank up, as highs will approach 90 degrees. Temperatures will
remain toasty heading into next week, but forecast models are indicating less
humidity in the area through the middle of the week.
