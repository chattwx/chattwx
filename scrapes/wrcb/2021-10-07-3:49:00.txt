Good Thursday. The awesome weather is almost here, but we will have to get
through a few more areas of heavy rain mainly east of Chattanooga this evening
and tonight with a few showers even lingering into the overnight. Heavy rain
will be the biggest threat with any cells that develop. Be careful out and about
on your Thursday night.

Friday we may get a few early morning showers, but most of the day will be
partly cloudy with the high reaching a tolerable 80 degrees.

The weekend looks good as well. Saturday will have a nice mix of sun and clouds
with a high of 81. We could see a few rogue showers in the Blue Ridge Mtns, but
that will be about it.

Sunday will be partly cloudy and dry with a high of 82.

Next week looks much the same with highs in the low 80s, partly cloudy skies and
no rain through Thursday.
