After rain this morning, isolated thunderstorms will be possible east of I-75,
mainly from 2PM through 5PM. The Marginal Risk for severe weather continues this
afternoon, where brief damaging wind gusts, and large hail will be possible.

Tonight will be quiet, with clouds clearing.

Friday looks great to start with sunshine in the morning. Thunderstorms will
develop late in the day around 4PM-6PM south in Georgia and Alabama. The rain
and storm chance will increase Friday night through Saturday Noon. At this time,
there is a Marginal Risk for severe weather, where damaging wind gusts and large
hail will be possible. However, the risk for severe weather is low, the greater
risk will be the heavy rain. Some areas could get 1" to 2" on Saturday morning,
which would lead to localized flooding.

The latter half of the upcoming weekend will be dry and quiet on Sunday. Very
little rain chances look likely next week with temperatures still cooling a bit
next week.
