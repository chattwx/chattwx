Good morning, today will once again begin with areas of patchy dense fog
especially along and near area lakes and streams. It'll be present until about
9-10am. Expect mostly clear skies during the early morning hours, but clouds
from the west are moving in. A layer of higher, thin clouds will pass over our
area for the midday and afternoon hours, making for a sunshine and cloud mix.
Highs today will be warm around 80 with a southerly breeze at 5-10mph. This
evening clouds will clear, only to increase again overnight with lows in the low
to mid-60s.

Tuesday will be partly sunny with isolated showers associated with a cold front.
Highs will be in the upper 70s to 80. Wednesday will remain partly sunny with
highs in the low 80s. Thursday and Friday will be mostly sunny with highs from
80-84. Then, Saturday will have a nice fall cold front. It'll be mild in the
morning with lows still in the 60s, but afternoon highs will only reach about 75
with clouds and rain. The cool air will be felt Sunday morning with lows in the
40s to 50.
