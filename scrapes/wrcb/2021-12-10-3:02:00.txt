Good Friday! For the rest of the evening, we can expect continued overcast
skies, light drizzles, and areas of fog. Temps will actually be warming through
the evening climbing through the 60s.

Saturday will start in the upper 60s. A cold front will bring a line of strong
storms into the Cumberland Plateau between 8am and 11am, the TN Valley 10am-1pm,
and the Blue Ridge Mtns noon-3pm (all times eastern).

Other than heavy rain and lightning, we will also be under threat from damaging
wind gusts of 40mph+ and isolated tornadoes.

The rain will be completely out of the area after 4pm, and colder air will
rapidly filter in.

Sunday temps will start in the low 30s and only make it to about 51 in the
afternoon.

We will start cold at 32 Monday, but warm nicely to a high of about 60.

The rest of the week will see steady warming to the upper 60s by Thursday. We
may get a few showers Friday.
