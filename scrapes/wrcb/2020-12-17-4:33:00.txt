Good Thursday. We are a bit colder this morning in the 30s. Skies are overcast,
but we will see clearing skies throughout the day. I don't expect much of a
warm-up today. Highs will only make it into the upper 30s and low 40s!

Friday will sport a bitterly cold start with morning temps in the low 20s, but
we will make it to the upper 40s in the afternoon. Skies will be sunny.

Saturday we will have partly cloudy skies with temps ranging from 28 in the
morning to 52 in the afternoon.

We will continue warming Sunday with temps around 40 in the morning and mid 50s
in the afternoon. I expect on and off light showers Sunday morning through
Sunday evening. Rainfall totals will be 1/4" to 1/2".

We will be reasonably mild and dry for the first half of next week with lows in
the mid 30s and highs in the mid to upper 50s.
