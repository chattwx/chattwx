Good Monday. It will remain warm and cloudy through the evening with temps in
the 60s and a sporadic sprinkle or two.

Tuesday will be about the same. We will have clouds and near-record highs in the
low 70s. Sporadic showers will be with us through the day, also.

Wednesday will be another warm one with a high of 72. We will see strong storms
moving in Wednesday night. Some of those storms may be severe so we will need to
be weather aware Wednesday evening. Some showers will linger into Thursday
morning. and we may have a sprinkle or two into Thursday afternoon. We, again,
will have highs in the low 70s Thursday.

Friday brings another high of 70 with more rain and storms Friday evening into
`Saturday. Saturday will feature showers on and off all day with a record-tying
high of 73.

We will have rain and storms all day Sunday as well with temps remaining in the
50s all day.

As temps continue to fall Sunday night into the 20s, we may actually have a
wintry mix of rain and snow Monday morning before clearing out in the afternoon
with highs Monday only in the 40s.
