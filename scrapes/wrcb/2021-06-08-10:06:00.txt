Happy Tuesday! Another day of high humidity is set for the Tennessee Valley.
High temperatures will top out in the mid 80s with heat index values reaching
the lower 90s by this afternoon. Skies will range from partly to mostly cloudy
throughout the day. Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms will develop this
afternoon.

 Lows will hover around 70 degrees tonight with any shower activity ending
early.

Wednesday and Thursday will feature highs in the mid 80s along with showers and
thunderstorms each afternoon.

Rain chances will decrease heading into the weekend as drier air starts to
filter into the area. Highs will return to the lower 90s, but humidity readings
will be lower making things a bit more tolerable!
