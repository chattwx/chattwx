Good Monday. A cold front has moved through, and cooler, breezy weather will be
the result today. As skies become sunny we will warm only to the mid to upper
50s today. Winds will blow from the north at 10-15 mph.

Tuesday will start much colder in the low to mid 30s. We will warm a bit to 64
in the afternoon.

Wednesday another front will bring some rain showers and a few thunderstorms in
during the afternoon and evening hours. We could get about 1/2" of rain.

Thanksgiving Day looks great. It will be partly cloudy and a bit mild with temps
ranging from 57 in the morning to 69 in the afternoon. No problems for Black
Friday either. It will be a little cooler in the morning in the mid 40s, but the
high will climb again into the upper 60s.

The weekend will see highs in the low 60s with maybe a few showers Saturday and
rain likely Sunday.
