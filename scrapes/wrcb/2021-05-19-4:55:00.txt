Sprinkles are likely through 8AM for our Tennessee communities. It's a mild and
comfortable morning in the upper 60s. Jackets are not necessary this morning,
and really won't be needed the rest of the spring season. Lows will remain in
the mid to low 60s, warming to the upper 60s next week again.

This afternoon will be quite comfortable as highs top 81-82.

Temperatures will warm on Thursday near 83-84.

The heat is still on tap to crank up on Friday. Just in time for early events
for Ironman. By race day on Sunday, the high looks to top 92-93. The best time
to be working and exercising on Sunday will be early in the morning, as
temperatures will be in the low 60s.

Please remember this weekend to stay hydrated, limit time outside during peak
heating hours of 10AM and 4PM, and never ever leave a child or pet in a vehicle.

TODAY:

6AM: 67, Sprinkles north

12PM: 73, Broken Clouds

3PM: 80, Broken Clouds
