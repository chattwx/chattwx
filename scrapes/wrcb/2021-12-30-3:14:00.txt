Good Thursday. We have a much less eventful evening planned with partly cloudy
skies and temps dropping through the low 60s into the upper 50s.

Friday we will start at 55 and climb to a warm 69 in the afternoon. Throughout
the day we may get a stray shower or two. In the evening one or two storms may
pop up, but they will also be few and far between.

Saturday will also see some isolated showers here and there. A line of strong
storms will move through Saturday night into the overnight hours of Sunday
morning as a front moves through. Colder air will be filtering in during the
day. We may even get some light snow showers as the moisture meets the cold air
late in the day. How much (if any) is still up in the air, but this is our best
chance for snow so far this year. Keep the snow dance going!

Monday will be flat-out cold with temps ranging from 29 to 44. It will remain
chilly and dry for the first half of the week at least.
