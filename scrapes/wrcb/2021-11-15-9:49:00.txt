Happy Monday, everyone! It's a beautiful looking day around the Tennessee
Valley. Temperatures started off in the 30s, but are warming into the 50s this
afternoon with plenty of sunshine and dry air. 

Tonight, look for mostly clear skies and calm winds. Temperatures will be a bit
warmer than the past few nights, with overnight lows in the upper 30s to lower
40s.

A southerly wind will kick in Tuesday, bringing a few more clouds, but also a
nice warming trend to the area. We will call it partly sunny Tuesday, with high
temps warming into the mid to upper 60s!

It gets even warmer by mid-week, with high temps warming into the 70s!

Our next cold front arrives on Thursday, bringing a few scattered showers,
followed by another drop in temperatures for the end of the week & weekend.
Highs will be back in the 50s and lows back near freezing this weekend.

Another front arrives to kickoff Thanksgiving week with a few more showers
Monday, followed by colder & drier conditions for the holiday week.
