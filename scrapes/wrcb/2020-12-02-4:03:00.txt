Good Wednesday. A "hard freeze" is defined as temps dropping into the 20s for
several hours. We are doing that with no problem this morning. We are bottoming
out in the upper 10s and low 20s this morning. This afternoon will be warmer
than yesterday, but still cool in the low 50s.

Thursday we will see clouds building. We will have a cold start in the mid 20s,
but warm to a nice high of 55.

Friday we will start warmer in the low 40s, but we will also start with rain for
the morning commute. I expect on and off showers through the day, tapering off
as we move through our Friday evening. We should get .5"-1" of rain Friday. The
high will be in the low 50s.

The weekend looks good. Saturday will be mostly cloudy with temps ranging from
41 to 52. Sunday will start colder in the low 30s, but warm nicely to a high of
52.
