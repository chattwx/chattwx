It's the most comfortable morning of the work week! Temperatures have dropped to
the 50s in the higher elevations.

Lots of sun today though - therefore temperatures will soar starting today,
reaching 87-88.

The stretch of 90Â° highs begins tomorrow, and continues through ALL of next
week. Starting Sunday, is when it will be close to the record high.

Record highs will be close to being broken Sunday through Friday of next week.
This is very abnormal heat for mid to late May. Please check up on those without
air conditioning units.

It will be a good idea to keep cool by heading to the Tennessee Aquarium, or
enjoying a movie at an indoor theatre during the peak hours!
