The risk for severe weather continues.

Most of the Tennessee Valley is under a Moderate Risk of severe weather today.
Particularly in the afternoon and evening.

It's highly discouraged to be outside today, and to stay close to a radar screen
as storms evolve.

The first round is reaching the Tennessee Valley this morning. Once this first
batch moves through, this will set the stage for a better thunderstorm threat
this evening. Areas west near Franklin, Grundy, Sequatchie, Bledose, Marion,
Jackson, and DeKalb have the best potential for tornadoes this evening from 5PM
to 11PM.

When a watch is issued, please head to open shelters as storms will be moving
very quickly, tracking 50, upwards to 60 mph.

Have a plan, and we'll get through this storm system together.
