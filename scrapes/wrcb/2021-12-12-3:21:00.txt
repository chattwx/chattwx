Happy Sunday, everyone! After a cold start, we got to enjoy plenty of sunshine,
and near- normal temperatures.

Tonight, skies will remain clear with fairly light winds. Temperatures will
quickly drop into the upper 30s this evening, and into the upper 20s and lower
30s by early Monday morning!

Monday will kick off another week and another warm up! Highs will climb to near
60 with plenty of sunshine. A few extra clouds will increase each day early this
week, but temps will also increase each day. Highs by mid to late-week will be
in the upper 60s to around 70 again! Yes, in case you were wondering, that's
about 15 degrees above where we should be this time of year.

Our next weather maker will approach the area by the end of the work week
bringing back rain chances the area by next weekend. Another shot of cold air
COULD finally follow this system to kick off the week of Christmas, stay tuned!
