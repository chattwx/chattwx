Good Monday. What a busy weather week. We are starting off great with sunshine
today and after a chilly start temps climbing into the mid 60s. Tuesday we will
warm into the mid 70s in the afternoon. We may get a few isolated rain showers
Tuesday night.

Wednesday we will call it a Storm Alert Weather Day. We will see another line of
storms moving through in the morning that could produce damaging winds along
with heavy rain and lightning. In the afternoon we will continue to see
scattered showers with highs making it to the mid 60s. I expect an inch of rain
Wednesday.

Overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning we will have much colder air moving in
as temps fall into the low to mid 30s. There may be enough moisture to produce
some light snow showers early Thursday morning. The models are not in agreement
on this, but there is some data suggesting we could get 1/2" to 1" of snow in
the higher elevations early Thursday morning (April 1st). Thursday afternoon we
clear out with highs in the mid 50s.

Definitely bring in the plants Friday. Temps will start in the upper 20s and low
30s, and only climb to the mid 50s in the afternoon.

Easter weekend will be cool and sunny. Saturday we will range from 35 to 64.
Easter Sunday will go from 41 to 72.
