Good morning, if you like warm weather, then today is your day to enjoy. We'll
have a mostly sunny sky with temperatures mild at noon in the 60s and afternoon
highs in the low 70s. Tonight will be partly cloudy with lows in the upper 40s
to low 50s.

Thursday is the raincoat day. It won't be heavy rain, but expect on and off
showers from west to east associated with a cold front. Highs will be near 65
with temperatures dropping once the cold front passes, so for Chattanooga and
westward, it should become cooler through the afternoon.

Friday will be sunny beginning in the 30s in the morning with highs from 50-54.
Saturday will be partly sunny with high clouds and highs near 58. Sunday will
have increasing clouds and dry during the daytime with highs around 60. Rain
will move in Sunday night into Monday morning, followed by the coldest air of
the season. Monday's official high should happen in the early morning hours with
daytime temperatures only in the 40s. Then, Tuesday morning will be in the 20s.
