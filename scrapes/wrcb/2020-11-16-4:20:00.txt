Good Monday. If you want to see any of the brilliant fall colors you need to
hurry. They are falling out of the trees (and into your yards) very quickly at
this point.

You will need the jacket or sweatshirt this morning and for much of the day. We
will only climb into the upper 50s and low 60s this afternoon with perfectly
blue skies.

If you have a mind to, go outside away from city lights late tonight and check
out some of the Leonid meteors shooting across the sky.

Tuesday through Thursday will remain nice and fall-like with clear skies, lows
in the mid to upper 30s, and highs around 60. Friday will be nice, but a little
warmer with the high making it to 68.

The weekend will be dry, but we will see an increase in cloud cover through the
weekend. Highs will be around 70 Saturday and Sunday. I do expect some rain
showers with a front moving through NEXT Monday.

Hurricane Iota will move through many of the areas of Central America already
devastated by Hurricane Eta. Iota is a major Category 4 hurricane with 145 mph
winds and will make landfall in Nicaragua late tonight into Tuesday morning.
