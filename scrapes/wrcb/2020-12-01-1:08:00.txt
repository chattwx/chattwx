Tonight should be the coldest night of the season. I am expecting lows in the
mid 20's in the city and in the upper teens in outlying areas. Sunshine will
return again for Wednesday with a warmer high near 50. Skies will be clear
Wednesday night with a low of 30. Thursday will see a few more clouds with highs
in the low 50's. Friday looks wet with highs in the mid 50's

This weekend will see clearing skies Saturday with highs in the mid 50's. Sunday
through Tuesday will be dry with mostly sunny to partly sunny skies. Highs will
be in the upper 40's to low 50's. Paul Barys
