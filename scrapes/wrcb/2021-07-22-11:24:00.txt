AIR

The Air Quality Index today for Hamilton County is in the Moderate Range for
fine particles. The AQI is 55. This means, those with asthma or on a ventilator
or oxygen need to limit time outdoors today, and especially Friday morning.

The smoke will thicken tonight and into Friday morning before improving. If you
don't have a respiratory illness, this will likely not impact you.

You may have noticed the near full moon had a hue last night, too. This is due
to smoke aloft. With a mostly clear sky tonight, the moon will likely have
another hue, and again on Friday night.

HAIR

Dew points will be in the 70s in the afternoons for the next week. It will be
useless styling the hair for a while. Pony it up.

DRY PATTERN

A dry pattern is setting up. With temperatures heating up, potted plants will
want a nice drink of water. You may have a few more days where recent rain has
fallen before breaking out the sprinkler systems.

TODAY:

12PM: 85 (Heat Index, 86-88)

3PM: 91 (Heat Index 92-94)

6PM: 89 (Heat Index 92-94)
