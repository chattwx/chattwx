What a great day our Tuesday was! Wednesday will be just as nice if not better.
We will start out much cooler with lows in the mid to upper 50s. Sunshine will
dominate and we will climb to a warm, but pleasant high of 85. The humidity will
remain low so it will be a spectacular day.

Thursday and Friday we will warm a little with highs in the upper 80s. Lows will
be warmer in the upper 60s. The humidity will be a little higher both days.

The weekend will see the humidity even higher so we will be back in the muggies.
Highs will remain in the upper 80s. We may see a few scattered showers and
storms both days of the weekend.
