Thursday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. An approaching cold front will bring in
two rounds of thunderstorms.

One will move through in the morning between 6 am and noon. I think we can
expect heavy rain, and possibly damaging winds with this round.

After lunch, we will have a spell with little to no rain which will allow us to
warm up to the low to mid-70s. The front will move through and usher in a second
round of spotty showers and storms. These will also have the potential to
produce damaging winds.

No tornadoes are expected with these storms.

Rainfall amounts Thursday will vary wildly anywhere from 1/4" all the way up to
2" under some of the heavier storms.

We will dry out and cool a bit Friday with the high reaching only 69

Saturday will be cool in the morning in the 40s and mostly sunny and,73 in the
afternoon.
