Happy Tuesday, everyone! It's a mostly cloudy and chilly day around the
Tennessee Valley. Temperatures will likely remain below normal in many spots,
thanks to the extra clouds and even a few sprinkles. Look for mostly cloudy
skies with scattered sprinkles, or even an isolated shower or two. Highs will
likely struggle to get out of the 40s today.

Clouds will likely hang around through the evening hours, but we're looking for
gradual clearing skies overnight. Low temperatures will drop to near freezing.
Wednesday will feature the return of our friend, Mr. Sunshineâ€¦but that's not
going to help temperatures much. In fact, highs will likely struggle once again
to climb out of the 40s around the area.

Thursday is our day of transition. Thursday morning will start off on a cold
note with temperatures in the 20s in many locations, but a warm front brings
southerly winds by the afternoon with highs in the mid-50s.

The big warm up arrives just in time for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day! High
temperatures will soar into the mid to upper 60s across the area for highs. We
will likely remain warm through the 1st half of next week.

A front will bring a very slight chance for a few isolated showers Friday night
into early Saturday morning, but overall the forecast looks mainly dry for any
outdoor Christmas festivities!

Have a great rest of your Tuesday!
