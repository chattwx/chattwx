Today has a lot happening with weather, but the biggest concern is the high
heat. Highs will range from 92-96, and it'll be very humid. Most of our
Tennessee counties are under a Heat Advisory from 12-8pm ET for heat index
values peaking around 105. Dade, Walker, and Catoosa Counties in Georgia have an
advisory from 11am-8pm ET for heat indices up to 108. The take home point is the
combination of hot air and humidity will lead to increased risk for heat related
illnesses today, particularly when doing strenuous work outside in the middle of
the afternoon. Please use caution and change your plans when possible to the
morning.

The other factors at play today are smoke and rain chances. We'll continue to
have wildfire smoke with air quality in the upper end of the Moderate category.
There will be a few minor spotty showers this morning with additional hit and
miss downpours this afternoon and evening associated with a cold front. If your
location receives rain, then you'll have the benefit of it not being as hot.

Now for the weekend, Saturday will remain hot with highs in the low to mid-90s,
a mostly sunny sky, and a small chance for an isolated shower. Sunday will be
cooler in the 80s with showers/storms in the early morning and again in the
afternoon.
