After a frosty morning down to 26, it is still way better than today's record
low, which is 9 from 1929!

Rain moves in for Friday morning's drive time. Showers will begin 6AM-8AM with
heaviest rain between 9AM and 12PM. By afternoon, showers will end west of I-75
by 2PM-4PM, and taper off east over Polk, Cherokee, Monroe, and Fannin counties
by 6PM-7PM. Depending on wind tomorrow, we'll need to watch for low visibility
tomorrow night.

Rainfall amounts Friday will range from 0.50" to 1", with the higher totals east
near Monroe, McMinn, Polk, Fannin, and Cherokee counties.

Temperatures tomorrow morning will be considerably better ~15 degrees better in
the upper 30s for morning drive time. A few mountain flurries will be possible
in the higher elevations early Saturday, but nothing that will be sticking.
