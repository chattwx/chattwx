What a beautiful spring afternoon -- low humidity, sunny skies, and feeling more
like April than May. It'll be in the low 70s to upper 60s this evening with
sunset at 8:49pm ET. Overnight, lows will be in the upper 40s to low 50s with
passing clouds in the early morning.

Memorial Day will be mostly sunny through about lunch with scattered clouds
developing for the afternoon. It'll be warmer in the low 80s, 84 in Chattanooga,
with a light southerly afternoon breeze. Beautiful weather for a ceremony
honoring the fallen, time out on the boat, or a cookout with family.

Tuesday will have increasing clouds with warm highs in the mid-80s. Wednesday
will be mostly cloudy with highs near 86. Dry during the daytime, showers will
move in for the evening. Then, Thursday and Friday will have on and off times of
rain and storms. They'll be a little cooler around 80. Next weekend should warm
again to the mid-80s with a mix of sun and clouds and a 30% chance for showers.
