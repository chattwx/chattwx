Good Tuesday. The rest of the day will be muggy and mostly cloudy with an
isolated shower or storm possible into the early evening. Tropical Storm
Nicholas will continue pumping moisture into our area through the rest of the
week. That will manifest itself as increasing cloud cover tonight. Wednesday we
will have a few showers in the morning and more widely scattered showers and
storms in the afternoon. Highs will only reach the upper 70s, but it will be
humid.

Thursday and Friday will also be cloudy with the high reaching 81 and spotty
showers mainly in the afternoon.

We may warm a few degrees over the weekend, but the pattern doesn't change much.
We will see spotty afternoon showers and storms both Saturday and Sunday. Heavy
rain will be the biggest threat over the next few days with any cells that move
through.
