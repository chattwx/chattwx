Good morning, Tuesday will begin with clouds across the area with spotty showers
moving through from west to east. As they move eastward, they're fading out, so
any rain should be brief and minimal, finishing before noon. Clouds will break
and partially clear for a pleasant afternoon with sun and highs around 60.
Tonight, clouds will increase with lows in the upper 30s to low 40s.

Wednesday and Thursday will be the two days of the week with the chilliest
weather. Skies will be mostly cloudy to cloudy with scattered showers,
especially for our south and eastern communities. Temperatures will stay in the
40s for most of the days with highs around 50. Friday will be partly sunny with
decreasing clouds and highs in the mid-50s. The weekend will warm a bit to
around 60 with plenty of sunshine.

Let's talk more about the cold. Lows in Chattanooga won't be bad in the upper
30s to low 40s, but our outlying counties will be in the mid-30s Wed-Sat
mornings, leading to the potential for frost. First up, Bledsoe County has a
Frost Advisory from midnight tonight to 10am on Wednesday morning.
