This string of very nice weather will continue for the rest of this week.
Tuesday will remain sunny with highs near 70. Tuesday night will be clear and a
little bit warmer with lows in the low 40's. Wednesday will see a few high
cirrus clouds and highs in the low to mid 70's. Thursday will continue warm with
highs in the mid 70's and partly cloudy skies.

Friday will be mostly cloudy and warm with highs again in the mid-'70s. This
weekend will have a few more clouds but temperatures will be well above normal
and in the mid to upper 70's on Saturday and near 70 on Sunday. The chance for
showers will be low on Saturday and even lower Sunday.

The chance for rain will go up quite a bit on Monday with highs in the mid to
upper 60's. We may even see a storm or two on Monday. Paul Barys
