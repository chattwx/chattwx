TODAY:

There is Marginal Risk for flash flooding today. This means, scattered showers
that develop will likely be slow movers and could result in heavy rain in a
localized area in a short amount of time.

This will be the case this evening and possibly into tonight. We're on the last
day of temperatures in the 80s, too.

WEEKEND:

90s Saturday through Tuesday.

The heat index both Saturday and Sunday will top 96-98. It will be a nice
weekend to be in the water with very low rain chances in both afternoons.

The dry pattern (for the most part) that starts this weekend will continue
through the middle part of next week. Possibly more rain by NEXT
Friday-Saturday.

TODAY:

12PM: 76, M. Cloudy with hit and miss showers

3PM: 83, Scattered Showers

6PM: 82, Scattered Showers
