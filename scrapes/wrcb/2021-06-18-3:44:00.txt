Good Friday afternoon. Moving through the evening we can expect temps dropping
through the 80s. Humidity will be increasing heading into tonight.

Saturday will be less hot, but more muggy. I think some of us will get some
spotty showers or storms from the tropical system in the gulf. We will have a
high of 86. Rain chance... 40%

Sunday will stay humid with a high of 87. Most of the tropical rain will stay
south of us, but a stray shower or two could certainly make it's way in. I'll
put the rain chance at 20%.

Monday through Tuesday morning a cool front will bring in scattered showers, and
maybe a thunderstorms or two. Tuesday afternoon we will dry out with the
humidity and temps dropping a little once again by the middle of the week.
