Good Thursday. It's another warm and muggy start this morning with only a few
spotty showers here and there. More widely scattered thunderstorms will pass
through this afternoon into this evening. I don't expect severe weather, but
heavy rain and lightning will of course be possible. Some showers could linger
into the overnight.

We will be warm and humid Friday as well with a high of 85. I don't think we
will have as many showers and storms, but we will still have a few.

The weekend will be hot and muggy with highs near 90. Rain chances are low, but
we might get a sprinkle Saturday evening, and another late Sunday afternoon.

Next week will remain hot near 90, but the humidity will be noticeably lower.
Little to no rain is in the forecast through next week.
