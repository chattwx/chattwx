What a difference a day makes! Today's quiet, pleasant January weather will
continue into the evening. If you are in an open area, try looking to the WSW
sky around 6:15-6:30pm. Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury will all be visible just
above the horizon. Overnight, clouds will increase with lows in the upper 20s to
low 30s.

Monday will be our most active weather day for the week ahead. Scattered light
rain showers and wintry mix/snow will arrive in our area around 5am and will
continue on and off throughout the day. Valley locations will have cold rain
while higher elevations, especially west of Chattanooga, will have pockets of
snow mainly in the morning and again at night. Any moisture will be minimal:
rain at 0.25" or less and snow at dusting to 0.5", locally up to 1" in the
highest elevations. Still use caution driving. Afternoon highs will be above
freezing in the low 40s.

Tuesday will have slowly decreasing clouds with highs in the upper 40s.
Wednesday and Thursday will be mostly sunny with highs around 50 and mid-50s,
respectively. Friday will be partly sunny, in the upper 40s, and with an
isolated shower chance. Next weekend looks cool again with highs only in the
40s.
