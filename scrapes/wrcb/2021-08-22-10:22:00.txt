The rain has finally wrapped up for the night! Skies will become mostly clear
overnight as lows drop into the lower-70s. Areas of patchy fog will be possible
after 3 AM through your Monday morning commute.

We are finally going to have a couple of days of sunshine on Monday and Tuesday.
Temperatures will be hot with highs ranging from 90-94 degrees each afternoon.
Heat index values could reach as high as 101 degrees during the late afternoon
hours. Be sure to take frequent breaks from work or exercise and drink plenty of
water over the next several days!

We will reintroduce rain chances Wednesday through the upcoming weekend as more
moisture moves back into the area. Highs will remain seasonable, ranging from
86-90 degrees each day. Overnight lows will range from 67-72 degrees.
