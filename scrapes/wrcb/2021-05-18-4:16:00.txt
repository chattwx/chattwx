A few sprinkles are likely for the morning drive, however measurable rain is not
anticipated.

Watch for wet roads in Georgia and Alabama this morning, however that will be
it!

Under a mostly cloudy sky, temperatures will reach 80-82 today.

The heat will continue to build this week, with the first 90° high by Saturday.
While I don't see us breaking the record high of 96 on Saturday, it's looking
possible it will tie on Sunday with a high of 93.

Climatologically, the first 90° temperatures don't begin until late June, so the
heat is well in advance this year.

TODAY:

6AM: 63, Sprinkles

12PM: 73, M. Cloudy

3PM: 77, Sprinkles
