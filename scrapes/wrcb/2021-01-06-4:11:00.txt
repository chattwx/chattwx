Good Wednesday. It is a cold and frosty start with temps in the upper 20s and
low 30s. This afternoon will be cool and nice with come clouds and highs in the
upper 40s and low 50s.

Thursday will start cold in the upper 20s and low 30s. Thursday afternoon we
will hit a high of 49, and rain showers will begin moving through. Look for on
and off showers through the evening with some of it possibly changing to a
wintry mix in the higher elevations.

Friday morning we will have temps in the low to mid-30s. I do expect a wintry
mix Friday morning with areas of mainly rain in the valley, and a mix of rain,
sleet, and snow in the mountains and on the plateau. Rain Thursday and Friday
will range from .5" to 1.5". Snowfall will range from just flurries in the
valley mix with rain to up to an inch in the upper elevations.

The weekend will be cold and dry. Lows will be in the upper 20s and low 30s.
Highs will be in the mid to upper 40s.
