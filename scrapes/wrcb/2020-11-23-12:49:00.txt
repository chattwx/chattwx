We will enjoy a cool autumn night with lows in the mid 30's. It should be colder
in outlying areas. Tuesday will see an increase in high clouds with a warmer
high in the low to mid 60's. Tuesday night should be warmer with a low in the
mid to upper 40's. Wednesday will see cloudy skies with showers developing by
afternoon and evening. The rain does not look heavy. Highs should be in the low
60's. 

Thanksgiving Day will be warm with highs near 70 and any morning showers ending.
Clouds will break up through the afternoon and into the evening. Black Friday
should be partly cloudy with high clouds and highs near 70.

This coming weekend may have scattered showers develop on Saturday and an
excellent chance for showers late Sunday. There may even be a few thunderstorms.
Highs Saturday will be in the low 60's with Sunday's highs will be in the mid
50's. Paul Barys
