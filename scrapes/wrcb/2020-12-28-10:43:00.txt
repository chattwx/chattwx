Clouds will persist this afternoon, but highs will top the 50s today.

The next weather maker I'm watching, moves in Thursday-Friday. Temperatures will
be 10 to 15 above normal for New Year's eve night. While rain begins Thursday,
storms, some on the strong side will be possible into New Year's Day, Friday.

Rainfall amounts of 0.75" to 1" looks likely as we head into the New Year.

As timing and specifics get closer to Thursday-Friday, please check back with us
for new information and changes. Friday is looking likely as a Storm Alert
Weather Day, at this time.

12PM: Cloudy, 50

3PM: Cloudy, 55

6PM: Broken Clouds, 53
