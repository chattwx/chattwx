A Marginal Risk for severe weather continues today. This is a Level 1 on the
scale. Isolated damaging wind gusts up to 60 mph will be possible with the
strongest storms. Some pea size hail is also possible with thunderstorms today.

The timing for the strongest thunderstorms is between 12PM and 6PM today.

Then, it turns quiet tonight. We'll need to watch for patchy fog on Friday
morning, but overall tomorrow will be a much nicer day with highs in the mid to
upper 80s.

Hot temperatures return this weekend. It will reach 90-92Â° on Saturday and
Sunday, with limited rain chances. Late in the day Sunday, we'll need to watch
for rain returning.

Next week looks wet too with higher humidity and rain chances each day.
