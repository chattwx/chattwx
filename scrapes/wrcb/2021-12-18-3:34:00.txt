Happy Saturday! On and off rain showers will continue this evening ahead of an
approaching cold front. Additional rainfall amounts of up to a quarter-inch will
fall across portions of the Tennessee Valley. A few rumbles of thunder will be
possible, but any severe threat will stay well to our south.

The rain will gradually taper off tonight as the cold front pushes to our east.
It will feel more like December on Sunday as colder air settles back into the
region. Daytime highs will return to the lower-50s with temperatures dropping
into the 30s Sunday night into Monday morning.

We will take a break from the December warmth Monday through Thursday as
temperatures remain seasonable. Highs will top out in the 50s each afternoon
with overnight lows dropping into the 30s during the overnight hours.

Next Friday is Christmas Eve, and it looks like it will be a warm one as highs
return to the 60s. The warmth will likely carry over into Christmas Day as the
latest forecast models suggest highs will top out in the mid-60s. No white
Christmas this year!
