Good Thursday. Heading out it will be nice with clear skies and temps falling
through the 60s this evening. We will see some clouds and MAYBE a stray shower
or two late tonight around 9pm-11pm. It won't be a frog-strangler, but maybe
take an umbrella to game 2 of the Lookouts doubleheader to be on the safe side.

We will clear out overnight and see cool temps again Friday morning in the mid
to upper 40s. Friday will be cool, sunny, and breezy all day as the high only
reaches 69.

Saturday will be partly cloudy and cool again with temps ranging from 49 to 71
in Chattanooga. There is a very slight chance for a shower around lunchtime, but
most will see nothing.

Mother's Day will be warmer with morning temps in the 50s and afternoon highs
climbing to about 80. We will get some showers, but not until late Sunday night
into Monday morning.

Next week will sport varying chances for rain through the week.
