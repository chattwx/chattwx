Good Tuesday. With the snow ending, we will now settle in for a day of cold.
This morning we are in the upper 20s and low 30s. Highs this afternoon will only
reach the upper 30s and low 40s as skies clear out. Winds will be light at 5-10
mph from the WNW, but even that light wind will put a little bite in the air.

It will get even colder tonight as we settle into a hard freeze. Temps will drop
into the 10s and low 20s Wednesday morning. We will warm a bit in the afternoon,
however, making it to a high of 51. The average high for today's date is 57.

Thursday temps will range from 27 in the morning to 53 in the afternoon. Clouds
will be increasing through the day with rain showers moving in Thursday night,
and lasting on and off through the day Friday. Temps Friday morning will be in
the low 40s so it will be only rain we are dealing with.

The rain showers will last into Saturday morning, ending late Saturday. Sunday
will be dry. Highs over the weekend will be in the low 50s. Lows will be around
40 Saturday morning and low 30s Sunday morning.
