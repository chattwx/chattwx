Some wonderful weather is moving in for the weekend. Skies will clear off for
tonight and lows will drop into the low 60's. Skies will be mostly sunny for
both Saturday and Sunday. Highs will be in the mid 80's on Saturday with low
humidity. Sunday will be warmer with humidity levels a little higher.

 

Monday will be partly cloudy, hot, and humid with highs in the low 90's. Tuesday
will remain hot and humid with a few isolated showers and storms during the late
part of the day. Wednesday through next Friday will be hot and humid with highs
near 90 and scattered afternoon and evening storms.

This will be my last forecast for you. I am retiring after the 6 PM news
tonight. It has been my pleasure working for you these past 36 years. You all
have been a wonderful audience and I appreciate all the kind thoughts and words
that everyone is sending me. I will continue with Paul's Pets in a few weeks, so
until then, goodbye everybody!
