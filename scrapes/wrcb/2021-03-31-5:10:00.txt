Good Wednesday. March is going out like a wet, soggy lamb. We already have 10.3"
of rain this month, and today will drop another 1.5" to 2.5" through the day. A
FLOOD WATCH is in effect for our area through this evening. River flooding will
likely be an issue for the next several days. The rain will be heavy at times
this morning through the early afternoon. Mid-afternoon through this evening the
rain will taper to just spotty showers. We may see a few isolated storms, but
this is primarily a rain event. Temps are in the 60s this morning and will be
cooling into the 50s this afternoon and the 40s this evening. Overnight we will
dry out and see temps falling into the low to mid-30s.

Thursday will be windy, chilly, and sunny. Highs will only make it into the
upper 40s and low 50s with winds blowing from the north at 15-25 mph.

Friday we need to bring in the plants as temps will range from 31 in the morning
to 55 in the afternoon.

Easter weekend will be sunny. Saturday we start cold in the low 30s, and make it
to a high of 64. Sunday we will bee in the upper 30s for the sunrise services,
and highs will climb to an amazing 70.

After today no rain is in the forecast through next week.
