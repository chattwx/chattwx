It'll be a cool and cloudy Saturday evening in the 40s. A few sprinkles will be
possible starting around 9pm, but generally, it'll be dry. Then, light rain
showers will arrive at midnight and continue until about 9am on Sunday morning
with lows from 35-40. For the most part, the rest of Sunday will be dry with
cloudy skies and highs from 46-50. Only a few spots of light showers will pop-up
here and there during the daytime. Total rainfall from tonight through Sunday at
0.1".

Monday will become mostly sunny and a little warmer with highs in the mid-50s.
Tuesday will be sunny with a high of 54. Wednesday will be in the mid-50s and
mostly sunny with more clouds by evening. 

Rain will start in the early hours of Thursday morning and continue during the
day for Christmas Eve. Rainfall will be heavy at times totaling 1-1.5". At this
point, there's quite a bit of discrepancy on when cold air will arrive. What we
do know is that we'll have rain on Thursday and by nighttime into Christmas
morning, it'll be much, much colder. Christmas morning lows will be from 20-24
and highs only in the mid-30s. What we don't know is whether cold air will
arrive in time to see a change over to some snow during Thursday daytime, or
just flurries Thursday night into Friday morning. Certainly check back for
updates.
