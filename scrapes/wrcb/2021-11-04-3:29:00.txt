Good Thursday. This evening will be much like last evening. The light mist we
have been enduring all day will subside after 7 pm, and we should have SOME
clearing as the night progresses. Temps will again be in the mid to upper 40s
this evening.

Friday we start colder. In the valley, we will be in the mid to upper 30s. There
is a FROST ADVISORY until 10 am for all counties in the TN Valley, north GA, and
the Blue Ridge Mtns. On the Cumberland Plateau we will make it down into the low
30s, and a FREEZE WARNING is in effect for Sequatchie, Grundy, Bledsoe, and Van
Buren counties until 9 central. Friday afternoon will warm to 58.

The weekend will sport cold mornings in the mid to upper 30s and sunny, nice
afternoons with highs of 62 Saturday and 65 Sunday.

Next week we will stay dry through Wednesday with highs making it into the upper
60s each day.
