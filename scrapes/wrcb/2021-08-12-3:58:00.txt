Good morning and good luck for the first day of school in Hamilton County! The
morning hours will have patchy dense fog in valleys through about 9am. Once the
sun is up, it'll warm quickly with a few isolated showers/storms possible. The
afternoon hours will once again be about both the heat and scattered storms.
Storms will develop from lunch through the early evening. Some of these could
become strong to severe with damaging wind gusts (primary threat), cloud to
ground lightning, heavy rain, and small hail. If your location doesn't receive
rain or increased clouds due to nearby storms, then it'll be hot and humid.
Highs today in the low 90s with heat index values in the upper 90s.

Friday will again be hot with highs in the low 90s, heat index near 100 with
scattered showers/storms ahead of a cold front. As the front gets closer on
Saturday, rain and storm chances will continue with highs around 90. The front
will stall over our area on Sunday with continued showers and storms likely. The
wet pattern will persist on Monday with cooler highs in the mid-80s. Tuesday may
have increased rain, depending on the path of Tropical Depression Fred.
