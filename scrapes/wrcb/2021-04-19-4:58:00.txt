Good Monday. We will be warm and pleasant this afternoon with highs in the upper
60s and low 70s under a partly cloudy sky. The tree pollen is extremely high
again, and will be for at least the first half of the week.

Tuesday will get even warmer with a high of 75.

Wednesday a strong cold front will slide through. It may bring a sprinkle or two
to the Cumberland Plateau early Wednesday morning, but by far the main impact
will be colder air. The high Wednesday will only make it to 59 degrees. We will
also be windy in the afternoon with 15-20 mph winds from the NW.

The chilly air keeps streaming in Thursday morning as lows drop into the mid to
upper 30s. I hate to say it, but frost may be a concern Thursday morning in some
spots.

Friday will be mostly cloudy with temps ranging from 44 to 68.

More rain moves in Saturday, but we will clear out Sunday.
