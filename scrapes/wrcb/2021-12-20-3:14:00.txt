Good morning, the weather will be back to feeling like December for today,
tomorrow, and Wednesday, and then we'll start another climb up in temperatures
leading to Christmas.

Today will be partly cloudy with some low level clouds this morning, and then
generally high clouds for the rest of the day with filtered sunshine. High
temperatures will be cool in the upper 40s to low 50s. Tuesday will be mostly
cloudy with an isolated shower chance and highs in the low 50s again. Wednesday
will be mostly sunny with a high near 53. Thursday morning will be very cold
with many locations in the 20s, but the afternoon will mark the transition to
warming temperatures with highs in the mid-50s and sunshine. 

Christmas Eve on Friday will be partly sunny with highs in the low 60s. We'll
have some scattered showers Friday night into Saturday morning, so keep that in
mind for church services and Santa! Saturday for Christmas will be mild with a
high of 64 and partly cloudy. For the latest, download the WRCB weather app.
