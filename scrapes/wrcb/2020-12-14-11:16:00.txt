Good Monday. We will be chilly and breezy through the afternoon with temps in
the mid to upper 40s. Winds will be blustery from the NW at 10-20 mph.

Tuesday will be cold all day with temps ranging from the upper 20s to low 30s in
the morning to the low 50s in the afternoon. Skies will be mostly sunny.

We will get more rain showers through the day Wednesday, totaling about another
1/2". Thursday and Friday will be chilly and dry.

I expect more rain showers this weekend Saturday evening into early Sunday
morning. Highs over the weekend will be in the low to mid 50s.
