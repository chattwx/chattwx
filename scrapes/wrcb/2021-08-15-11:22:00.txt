1-3" of rain has fallen across much of the area today. Minor flooding will be
possible through 2 AM as heavy rain continues to fall along and east of the I-75
Corridor. Most of the rainfall will begin to dwindle by daybreak Monday. Areas
of patchy fog will be possible tomorrow morning with temperatures starting in
the 70s.

Monday will feature a very similar weather pattern with showers and storms
developing during the afternoon hours. Highs will top out in the mid-80s.

Tuesday will likely be our wettest day of the upcoming week as the remnants of
Fred track into the Tennessee Valley. Periods of rain and thunderstorms will
lead to flash flooding concerns, especially in southwestern North Carolina and
northern Georgia. 1-3" of rainfall is expected with locally higher amounts east
of the I-75 corridor.
