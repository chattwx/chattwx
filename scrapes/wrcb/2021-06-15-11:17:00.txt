Good Afternoon,

LOW HUMIDITY:

 Dew points are continuing to drop out there – it's dropped to the mid 50s,
feeling splendid. It will be a window down evening and a nice reprieve from the
humidity through Thursday.

TONIGHT:

 Some AC units will get a break tonight.
Lows will be ~10 below normal for mid June, dropping to the upper 50s. The
normal low is 68° this week. The record low for tonight is 49, so not getting
that cool, but certainly cool for June. 
Lows will flirt with the 50s through Thursday night before temperatures warm
again Friday.

FRIDAY-NEXT MONDAY

The end of the week is looking hot, and humidity will creep back up on Saturday
as possible tropical moisture reaches us. Still a decent amount of varying with
forecast data – it will depend if Claudette can form in the Gulf this week. 
There is still a 70% chance of formation in the next 5 days. At best, it looks
like 0.30" to 0.60" this weekend, with highest amounts south for our Alabama and
Georgia communities. That is very preliminary at this time though. And while the
humidity creeps up this weekend – it's only brief.

A cool front arrives on Monday bringing some rain, but more low dew points for
next week, which would be a fabulous start to Astronomical Summer next week.
