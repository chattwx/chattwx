Happy Sunday! Scattered showers will begin to move into the area this morning as
a cold front approaches from the west. The rain will be heavy at times,
especially during the afternoon hours. 1-2" of rainfall will be possible with
locally higher amounts along the Plateau. A few rumbles of thunder will be
around, but the severe threat will stay to our south. Be sure to pack your rain
gear if you are heading out and about today!

The rain will move out this evening with skies gradually becoming clear tonight.
Overnight lows will drop back below freezing as colder and drier air settles in
behind the cold front.

We will start the work week with plenty of sunshine and chilly daytime
temperatures in the 40s. Highs will return to normal by the end of the week,
with minimal rain chances through Friday afternoon.
