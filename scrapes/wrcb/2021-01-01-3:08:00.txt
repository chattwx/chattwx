Happy New Year! Unfortunately, to kick-off 2021, we have a Storm Alert Weather
Day. First up are rain showers in the early morning. Then, from about 8am to
3pm, we'll have bands of rain and storms that will move across our area ahead of
a cold front. It'll be during this timeframe that we'll have an isolated risk
for a few strong to severe storms. This is a low-end event (Level 1 Marginal
risk). Threats are for isolated damaging wind gusts up to 60mph, and a tornado
can't be ruled out. Make sure you have multiple ways to receive weather
notifications today, especially if you're south and west of Chattanooga. Today
will be warm with highs in the upper 60s to low 70s and breezy with wind at
10-20mph, gusts 25-35mph.

By evening, showers will have tapered off and clouds start to break. Overnight
will be mostly cloudy with lows in the mid-40s and patchy fog. Saturday will be
partly sunny with highs in the low 60s. Dry during the day, scattered showers
will move in for the evening and night. Sunday will be partly sunny and cooler
in the low 50s. Monday will have lots of sunshine and a high of 54. Tuesday will
be mostly sunny and 55. Wednesday will have some high clouds and mid-50s. Then,
rain returns again for Thursday.
