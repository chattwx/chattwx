Good Thursday. We will remain a little breezy through this evening with temps in
the low 50s. I think we can expect a few light rain showers late tonight through
the overnight.

Friday we will start at 49 with clouds and spotty showers. We will continue to
see spotty showers on and off all day. Our temps will do a slow crawl to a high
of 66 just before midnight! We can also expect very gusty winds Friday night
into Saturday morning with winds gusting between 35 and 45 mph.

Saturday the front will move through. As it does we will see the wind gusts
increasing to 50 to 60 mph. I also expect a line of storms to move through that
will also produce periods of heavy rain and lightning. The rain and storms will
start around 9 am over the Cumberland Plateau, and then slowly move through.
However, even after the main line we will continue to see periods of rain
through the evening hours. Rainfall amounts will range from .5" to almost 2". Be
prepared for power outages and downed trees with this system.

Cold air moves back in Sunday with sunshine all day and temps ranging from 35 to
54.

Next week will feature a slow warming trend that will see us at about 70 by
mid-week. No rain is on tap for next week.
