Merry Christmas! Pockets of snow showers will continue this morning until about
10am. These will produce up to 0.5" of additional snow, especially along the
Cumberland Plateau and other ridgelines as it moves eastward. Even if you don't
receive new snow this morning, from snow yesterday and overnight plus
yesterday's rain, please be careful driving this morning. Particular care needs
to be taken in our eastern counties and up in the higher elevations as there are
reports of snow covering some roads. Black ice will be another concern. The
biggest problem spots will be on sheltered secondary roads, bridges, and
overpasses.

Now, let's talk temperatures. Today will be very cold. Air temperatures will
stay in the 20s for most of the day with wind chills in the teens to low 20s.
Wind will be from the west at 10-15mph. We'll have a mix of sun and clouds with
a wave of clouds to roll in around lunch into the afternoon. Tonight will be
mostly clear and even colder with lows from 15-20. Thankfully, the wind will be
decreasing.

Your weekend will be really nice. Generally sunny skies both days. High of 45 on
Saturday and 53 on Sunday. Monday will be mostly cloudy with a small chance for
an isolated shower and 51. Tuesday will be partly cloudy and in the low 50s.
Rain returns on Wednesday and Thursday.
