The rest of your Saturday will feature mostly sunny skies with a few passing
clouds from time to time. Temperatures will fall into the lower-70s this evening
before dropping into the 50s overnight under clear skies.

Sunday will be just as nice as highs reach the upper-70s along with plenty of
sunshine. Perfect weather for IRONMAN!

Temperatures will turn slightly warmer next week as highs range from 80-85
degrees each afternoon. Overnight lows will be comfortable, hanging out around
60 degrees. No rain is in the forecast over the next 7 days.

In the tropics, Hurricane Sam continues to strengthen and is now a major
hurricane. It is still too early to determine if Sam will have any impacts on
the United States.
