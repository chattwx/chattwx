A Winter Weather Advisory is valid for Grundy county tonight beginning at 9 PM
CST until 12 PM CST Saturday morning.

A strong cold front will move in tonight and that will keep the temperatures
well below the normal high of 50. I am expecting highs near 40. Winds will be
brisk and out of the west at 20 mph with stronger gusts. Occasional snow showers
will dot the terrain with some light accumulation in the higher elevations..
Lows Saturday night will be near 30. Sunday will mostly cloudy to cloudy with
highs in the mid to upper 40's and a southwest wind to 15 mph.

Monday through Wednesday will be dry with highs in the upper 40's Monday and in
the low 50's Tuesday and Wednesday. More rain will move in for Thursday with a
warm high near 60. Friday showers will end with highs in the low 50's. Paul
