Happy Sunday! It is shaping up to be a warm end to the weekend as high
temperatures top out in the mid to upper-70s. Skies will remain mostly sunny
through the afternoon with clouds building later in the day. Overall, an A+ end
to the weekend!

Monday will be a completely different story. A cold front will push through
during the mid-morning hours, sparking scattered showers and thunderstorms.
There will be the potential for a few strong storms with gusty winds and small
hail. Be weather aware and be sure to pack your umbrella before you head out the
door on Monday morning.

Tuesday and Wednesday look to stay dry under partly cloudy skies. Temperatures
will be seasonable with highs ranging from 64-68 degrees and overnight lows
dipping into the upper-40s.

Our next rain maker arrives Thursday morning as a slow moving low-pressure
system moves in our direction. Scattered showers will be around through Saturday
morning before moving out of the area. Temperatures will be cooler than average
with highs ranging from 58-63 degrees.
