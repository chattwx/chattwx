Happy Mother's Day!

Today will be a tale of two weather parts.

First Part of Day

The morning through about 2pm EDT will be mostly sunny with a few intervals of
passing high clouds. Great weather for your Mother's Day brunch. It'll be around
73 degrees by noon. However, it will be windy. Wind will increase by about
10am/9am CT out of the south to southwest and will continue through the
afternoon. Wind Advisories are in place for sustained wind at 15-25mph and gusts
up to 35-40mph. Mid-afternoon will be partly sunny with highs around 80.

Second Part of Day

Showers will enter our northwestern counties around 4pm/3pm CT. The first group
will mainly be showers with a few embedded storms. Then, from about 7pm to 12am
EDT, heavier rain and stronger storms will arrive. A few isolated strong to
severe storms will be possible. The primary threat will be damaging wind gusts.
Most of our counties are under a Level 1 Marginal Risk from the Storm Prediction
Center. These events will make outdoor Mother's Day dinner plans questionable,
especially late dinners.

Impacts

Combining the windy conditions earlier in the day with night storms, we could
see some tree limbs or trees down like we had on Tuesday and Thursday of this
past week. Localized power outages will be possible.

Rain will continue into Monday morning, but any storms will be weakening. Monday
will be cooler with highs around 70, a few light showers, and a northwest
breeze. Clouds clearing in the evening.
