A few high clouds will move across the sky tonight and lows will drop into the
upper 20's. Clouds will increase for Saturday and highs will climb to near 50.
Clouds will thicken up Saturday night with lows near 40. Sunday will be cloudy
with a few scattered light showers and highs near 50 again.

Next week will start off warmer with partly cloudy skies and highs in the
mid-'50s. Tuesday should be sunny with the mid-'50s again. Clouds will be
increasing Wednesday with mid 50's one more time.

Christmas Eve (Thursday) will see rain move in and slowly change over to snow
all over our area. The only accumulations I see now will be in the higher
elevations. But there will be a lot of changes in the forecast charts before
then, so stay tuned. Christmas Day (Friday) looks cold with highs in the mid
30's and clearing skies. Paul Barys
