Good morning, Wednesday begins with cool air, but not quite as cold as the past
couple of mornings. Once again our afternoon highs will be above normal and mild
in the low 60s. Today will be mostly sunny. Some clouds will increase late
afternoon into the evening, and then become mostly cloudy overnight with lows in
the low to mid-40s.

Thursday will be mostly cloudy with highs in the mid-60s. It'll generally be dry
with only a few isolated shower chances, primarily for our northern communities.
Friday still looks to be the warmest day of the week topping out in the upper
60s to 70 with a mostly cloudy sky and a couple more isolated showers. Saturday
will be the day to have the raincoat handy with on and off showers, possibly a
few rumbles of thunder mixed in. Highs near 67. Temperatures will then drop on
Sunday with highs only in the low 50s and a partly sunny sky. Monday and Tuesday
will remain with the cooler highs near 53.
