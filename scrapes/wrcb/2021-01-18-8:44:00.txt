The weather is kicking off, splendid on this Monday. Sunshine will prevail with
highs near 52-54 today.

Tomorrow there will be passing clouds and a stray shower (all liquid), bringing
only 0.01" to 0.10" from 1PM to 7PM as a weak cold front moves through. Highs
tomorrow, will make it to the mid 50s.

And, it looks like highs in the 50s will be the trend for most of the week, too!
Good news there arctic air will remain to the north of the TN Valley.

Next chance of rain arrives Thursday-Friday. This does not look to be a big
event, bringing 0.30" to 0.60" through Friday morning.

12PM: M. Sunny, 44 (Wind Chill, 36)
