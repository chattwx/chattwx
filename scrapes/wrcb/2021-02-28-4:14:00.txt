The rest of Sunday afternoon will have scattered hit and miss showers/storms
with cloudy skies and warm temperatures in the 70s. Wind will be from the south
at 10-15mph with gusts at 20-30mph. Then, there will be a little bit of a lull
period, followed by our active nighttime weather.

We will be in STORM ALERT WEATHER mode for the overnight hours. The timing is
11pm to 5am EST with the greatest focus from 12-4am. Both isolated strong to
severe storms and flooding will be threats during the night. Please, have a plan
with Weather Radios and app notifications "on." A system will move from west to
east, weakening as it moves eastward. The leading edge will be strongest,
producing heavy rain, lightning, and gusty winds. The tornado threat is low, but
it's not zero.

SEVERE STORMS: The risk for isolated severe storms now includes the majority of
our viewing area at a Level 1 out of 5, so it's best for everyone to be ready.
Grundy and Van Buren Counties especially need to stay aware at a Level 2 threat. 
HAZARDS: Damaging wind and isolated tornado

FLOODING: Rain will be heavy at times, potentially causing flooding. Flood
Watches will be in effect for Hamilton, Marion, Sequatchie, Bledsoe, Rhea,
Meigs, Grundy, Van Buren, and Jackson Counties. Total rainfall at 0.75-1.5",
locally up to 2".

Rain will continue after the 5am time listed above, decreasing to light and
moderate for the morning commute. Then, it'll fade out through the rest of the
day. Monday's official high will be at midnight in the mid-60s with temperatures
dropping through the 50s during the day.
