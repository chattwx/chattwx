Good Morning

Temperatures are clearly much colder this morning. Grab a jacket as you head
out. Watch for patchy dense fog in the higher elevations of Polk, Fannin,
Gilmer, and Grundy counties this morning.

For most, and in the valley, expect sunshine early, followed by evening clouds.
For initial game time tonight for the Lookouts, it looks quiet, however rain
looks possible by 9PM-11PM for Hamilton County - baseball goers could get rain
by the latter half.

While winds have subsided, they will pick up again tonight with this next wave
moving through, gusting, 25-30 mph tonight. Rain will be light however ranging
from 0.01" to 0.10" from mainly 9PM through Midnight.

Friday looks great with sunshine, and highs near 70!
