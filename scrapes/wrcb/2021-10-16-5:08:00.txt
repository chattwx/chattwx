Good Saturday. As we head into the evening we will be cool and crisp with clear
skies and temps falling through the 50s. Temps will keep dropping overnight into
the low to mid 40s.

After the cool start Sunday we will have another beautiful afternoon with
sunshine and a high of 77.

Monday will be picture perfect to start the week with sunny skies and temps
ranging from a chilly morning low of 44 to a stunning 70 in the afternoon.

Tuesday and Wednesday will feature a bit more cloud cover with highs reaching
the low 70s.

Another front will approach Thursday increasing clouds and pumping the high up
to about 75. The front will bring a few widely scattered showers Thursday night,
then we will dry out again Friday with slightly cooler air moving back in for
next weekend.
