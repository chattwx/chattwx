Good morning, as if we didn't have enough to deal with today in the weather
world, there will be areas of valley fog/mist this early morning.

Thursday is a Storm Alert Weather Day with rain, freezing rain, sleet, and snow
all possible across our area. General timing is 9am-7pm ET from W to E with
residual light snow/flurries through about 10pm. The farther to the north you
are in Tennessee, the more likely winter precipitation is for you. The farther
to the south in Georgia, the more likely cold rain.

Snowfall rates should remain light to moderate.

Far north GA communities: minimal if any snow accumulations, a few mountains up
to 1".

Valley spots in TN: dusting-2" - lower end for Chattanooga and Cleveland, higher
end to the north for Pikeville and Athens

Plateau: 1-3" - greatest north and highest elevations

Polk County: spotty 1-2" - minimal event in Cherokee County in NC

Sleet and freezing rain will also mix in. A big concern will be any ice
accumulations from freezing rain. Please use extra caution for slick spots on
roads, particularly along the borders of TN/GA/AL and up through the southern
plateau.

It'll remain in the 30s through the afternoon, and fall into the 20s in the
evening. Overnight lows will be in the teens and wind chills dropping into
single digits for some locations. Thus, whether you have rain or snow today,
everyone will feel the bitter COLD Friday morning. Be careful driving overnight
and Friday for black ice on bridges, overpasses, untreated roads, and on
elevated surfaces while walking.
