We sure have picked up our fair share of rain this week. Over the last 24 hours
in Chattanooga, 1.37" in the rain gauge. A Flood Warning has been issued for the
Lookout Creek at New England. A minor flood stage up to 12 ft is expected this
afternoon. The flood warning will expire at 7pm ET. When the creek reaches 12
ft, water levels reach Sells Lane in Trenton, Mason Road near Rising Fawn, and
Creek Road near New England.

Another minor band of wintry mix arrives by 3PM-4PM and moves out by 7PM-9PM.
This will have much less of an impact, bringing a rain/snow mix to perhaps
Grundy county, but very light rain to the rest of the Tennessee Valley. Rainfall
amounts with the second round will range from 0.01" to 0.10" this evening.

If there is still any ponding on roads along the Cumberland Plateau tonight,
freezing temperatures are expected. This could cause some icy secondary roads
and decks on Friday morning.

A dry pattern is setting up Friday through Sunday. We'll enjoy sunshine with
highs in the mid 50s by Sunday.

Next rain chance arrives Monday. At this time, it's looking too warm for winter
precip. Next week's trend is also indicating more 60Â° highs.

TODAY:

12PM: Drizzle, 43

3PM: Light rain/flurries on the plateau, 48

6PM: Light rain , 41
