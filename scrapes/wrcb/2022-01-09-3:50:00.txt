Happy Sunday! Rain showers will taper off around 7 PM from west to east. Most
locations have picked up between 0.50-1" of rainfall today. After the rain ends,
temperatures will slowly fall into the 30s tonight into Monday morning. Most of
the roadways will dry pretty quickly after the rain ends, but a few areas of
black ice will be possible for your Monday morning commute. It is a low threat,
but something to be mindful of for your commute!

We will start the work week with plenty of sunshine and chilly daytime
temperatures in the 40s. Highs will return to normal by the end of the week,
with minimal rain chances through Friday afternoon. Unsettled weather will
likely return next weekend.
