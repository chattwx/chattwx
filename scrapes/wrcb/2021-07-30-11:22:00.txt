The Heat Advisory has been cancelled for all Chattanooga metro counties for
today. The morning cloud cover did us a lot of favors and we'll remain partly
sunny for the afternoon. You can now expect highs in the low 90s with heat index
values topping out in the low triple digits. Chattooga and Gordon Counties are
still under a Heat Advisory until 8pm ET tonight. Please continue to use caution
during the hottest hours of the afternoon and early evening with outdoor work.

The other factors at play today are smoke and rain chances. We'll continue to
have wildfire smoke with air quality in the upper end of the Moderate category.
There will be hit and miss showers/storms this afternoon and evening associated
with a cold front.

Now for the weekend, Saturday will remain hot with highs in the low to mid-90s,
a mostly sunny sky, and a small chance for an isolated shower. Sunday will be
cooler in the 80s with showers/storms in the early morning and again in the
afternoon.
