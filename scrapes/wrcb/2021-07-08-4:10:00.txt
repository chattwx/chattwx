Today won't have as much rain as yesterday, but we'll still have scattered
showers and storms (30%). Starting off this morning, they're few and far between
but spotty showers will last until about 8am. Then, hit and miss downpours and
storms will develop in the afternoon to evening. They'll move in the more
traditional direction from west to east instead of south to north like we had
yesterday. It'll be a mostly cloudy day with highs in the mid-80s. Tonight will
become partly cloudy with lows in the upper 60s to low 70s.

Rain chances will increase again on Friday with a chance for scattered showers
in the morning, and then showers and storms becoming more likely for the
afternoon. It'll be a partly sunny day with highs in the mid-80s.

For the weekend, both days will have temperatures in the 80s and hit and miss
showers/storms. As of now, Saturday's coverage looks to be less than Sunday if
you plan to be outside. Monday and Tuesday will have additional times of
showers.
