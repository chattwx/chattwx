Today will feature cloudy skies, times of showers, and mild temperatures for the
middle of December. A few light showers are east of Chattanooga early this
morning. Then, we'll be in a bit of a break period with showers beginning again
by about 10/9AM CST to the west. Generally, rain today will be light, totaling
about 0.25", but the chance for on and off showers will continue all day long so
grab the raincoats. Highs will be around 60. Showers will end tonight from west
to east with clouds decreasing overnight and lows from 40-45.

Sunday will be the better day of the weekend for outdoor plans. It'll be partly
cloudy during the daytime with highs near 60. Sunday night widespread heavier
rain will arrive and last into Monday morning. Highs on Monday will be cooler at
52 with a dry afternoon and breaking clouds. Tuesday will be mostly sunny with
highs in the low 50s. Wednesday will have showers again and cool staying in the
40s. Thursday looks mostly sunny with highs only in the mid-40s. Friday will
have lots of sunshine and highs in the upper 40s.
