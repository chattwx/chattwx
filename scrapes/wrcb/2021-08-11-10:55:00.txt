Another hot afternoon is in store for the Tennessee Valley as highs will range
from 89-94 degrees with heat index values as high as 102 degrees. The high heat
and humidity will provide fuel for thunderstorms between 2-8 PM. Similar to
yesterday, the storms will be hit or miss. The storms that develop today will
have the potential of being strong. Wind gusts of 40+ mph, small hail, and
frequent lightning will be possible. Those who stay dry will be dealing with
mostly sunny skies and hot temperatures.

A hot, stormy pattern will continue through the end of the workweek. By the
weekend, rain chances will increase as a cold front approaches the area.
Temperatures will turn slightly cooler next week as the cold front pushes to our
south.

In the tropics, Tropical Storm Fred has become the 6th named storm of the
Atlantic hurricane season. The storm is currently moving through the Caribbean
and could impact the Gulf Coast region early next week. Depending on the storm's
track, the Tennessee Valley could be dealing with impacts in the
Tuesday-Wednesday time frame of next week.
