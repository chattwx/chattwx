Good Tuesday afternoon. The theme of our weather will be more heat and humidity.
This evening we will drop from 90 at 7 pm down to the low 80s by 10 pm. Skies
tonight will be partly cloudy.

Tuesday we will ramp it up even more. We start in the mid to upper 60s (70 in
Chattanooga) and climb to a muggy 92 in the afternoon. The heat index will be at
about 95. I won't rule out a stray afternoon shower, but they will be few and
far between.

Wednesday we will get a few more scattered showers and storms in the afternoon,
though I will put the chance at 30% so some of you may go without even a drop.
The high Wednesday will get to 93!

Thursday a front will up our chances for scattered showers and storms for mainly
the afternoon hours. The high will be 87.

Friday we may get a few spotty showers or storms \with a high of 86.

The weekend will see highs near 90, lots of humidity, and only a few summertime
afternoon storms each day.

"Elsa" will move through the southeast on Wednesday and Thursday, but will have
little, if any, impact on our weather.
