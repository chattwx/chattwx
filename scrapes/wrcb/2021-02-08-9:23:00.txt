Highs through Thursday will be above normal in the mid 50s to near 60!

Clouds roll in tonight with lows in the upper 30s. Overt the next two days,
Tuesday and Wednesday could bring an isolated shower to the Blue Ridge
Mountains. That's about it. The next weather maker arrives Thursday. Given mild
temperature to near 60, a cold front moving through Thursday night could bring a
few thunderstorms. Especially near AL and GA in the TN Valley. Showers and
storms arrive Thursday evening-Friday morning. Rain at this time looks highest
west of I-75, where 0.50" to 0.60" is possible. Most look to get under 0.50" by
Thursday night.

Then-the trend gets cooler starting Friday and into the weekend. As the cold,
arctic air has been north of us, it may begin to seep into the Tennessee Valley
by weekend, briefly from Saturday night through Monday of next week.

As for the upcoming weekend, showers arrive Saturday PM with a transition of
minor winter precip Sunday morning.
