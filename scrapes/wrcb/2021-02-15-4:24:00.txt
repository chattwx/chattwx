WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY for Marion, Bledsoe, Sequatchie counties through 9am
central. Light freezing drizzle. Light glaze to 1/10" of ice.

WINTER STORMS WARNING for Grundy county this afternoon through Tuesday morning.
Heavy wintry mix with light ice accumulations.

This morning on the Cumberland Plateau we have a foggy, misty, freezing drizzle
with temps in the upper 20s and low 30s. In the Tennessee Valley, north Georgia,
and the Blue Ridge we can expect a few showers late morning, but very heavy rain
this afternoon into early evening. I expect about 1" of rain with possible
street flooding in some of the heavier rain bands. The rain will end late
tonight.

Tuesday will be MUCH colder. We will drop to the low to mid 20s so certainly any
moisture still on the roads will freeze and I would expect some patchy areas of
ice Tuesday morning. Tuesday afternoon we will only make it to 36 with a mix of
sun and clouds.

Wednesday we will start cold in the low 20s and warm to 48. I expect more rain
showers Wednesday evening into Thursday morning with a light wintry mix on the
plateau possible once again.
