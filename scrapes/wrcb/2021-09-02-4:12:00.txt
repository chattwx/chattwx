We're in for some delightful weather for the next few days. Today will be sunny
with relatively low humidity and highs in the low 80s - 84 in Chattanooga. For
the first football games for the Mocs and Vols tonight, it'll be in the 70s.
Fantastic weather for an early September game. Overnight, high thin clouds will
move into the area with lows in the upper 50s to low 60s.

Friday will be in the low to mid-80s with a layer of thin clouds and sunshine.
Saturday will be mostly sunny in the mid-80s. Sunday will have a mix of sun and
clouds with highs in the mid-80s and only a few isolated PM showers/storms.
Labor Day will be partly cloudy with scattered showers/storms and highs in the
mid-80s. Although there are rain chances on both Sunday and Monday, it certainly
won't be raining all day, so outdoor holiday plans should not be ruined.
