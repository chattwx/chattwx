Happy 1st day of October! Patchy dense morning fog will happen again this
morning until about 10am. It'll be mostly cloudy in the morning hours with
clouds decreasing slightly for a partly sunny afternoon and early evening. Highs
today will be from 80-84 for most locations. Friday Night Football games and the
3 Sisters Bluegrass Festival will be warm in the 70s. Then, overnight lows will
be mild in the low to mid-60s.

Saturday will be the "pick day" of the weekend -- generally dry and partly sunny
with highs near 84. There's a small chance for a couple of PM spotty showers
along area mountains. Then, an active weather pattern will start up on Sunday.
Sunday morning should remain dry with scattered showers/storms arriving Sunday
afternoon. Highs will be cooler in the mid to upper 70s. The rain will continue
into Monday ahead of a cold front. Once the front passes, we'll still have
scattered shower chances on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday with highs in the
mid-70s and lows in the low 60s.
