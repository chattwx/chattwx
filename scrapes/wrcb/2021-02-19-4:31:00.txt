Good Friday! We are off to a chilly start this morning. Temps are in the low
upper 20s and low 30s. On the Cumberland Plateau there may be patchy areas of
ice. Skies are cloudy this morning, but we will clear out through the day with
sunny skies and highs in the mid 40s.

Tonight will be another night to take care of the "Four P's". We will drop into
the 10s and low 20s so protect the people, pets, pipes, and plants in your life.
Saturday afternoon will be cool and sunny with the high reaching about 50. We
will be a little warmer Sunday with more sunshine and temps ranging from 28 to
56.

Another front will bring rain showers to the area Monday morning. Temps will be
in the low 40s so no worries about snow or ice. Monday afternoon we will clear
out again with the high reaching 52.

Tuesday and Wednesday we will be in the low to mid 60s!
