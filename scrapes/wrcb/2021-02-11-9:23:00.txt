It's a wet paws day, as rain will be on and off through 7PM-9PM tonight.

A cold front is moving through-but it's not bringing a big blast of cold air. In
fact, lows tonight will still be 8-10 above normal near 40-42. This morning, it
only dropped to 49Â° in Chattanooga.

Clouds look to prevail into Friday. Perhaps some peeks of sun, but where some
brief clearing occurs late tonight-patchy fog will likely develop for Friday
morning's commute.

Friday does look dry, however showers will return by Saturday morning. Those
east of I-75 will have the best chance for rainfall during the day Saturday,
picking up 0.25" to 0.50" by Saturday night. This looks to be all rainfall.

Sunday will dry under a partly cloudy sky with highs in the upper 40s. It will
be a cold Valentine's weekend, with nights returning to the low 30s.

TODAY:

12PM: Wet, 52

3PM: Rain off and on, 51

6PM: Rain off and on, 50
