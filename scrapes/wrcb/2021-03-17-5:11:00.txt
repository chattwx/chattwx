Good Wednesday. We are dealing with drizzles and areas of fog this morning.
Temps are in the low 50s. Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day. This afternoon we
will start to see heavy rain and strong storms streaming in from the west.

These storms will have the potential to produce not only heavy rain and
lightning, but also damaging winds, hail, and isolated tornadoes. I expect
storms to start moving through around 1 pm and last on and off through 11 pm. We
will get a break for an hour or two, but another line of very strong storms will
move through between 2 am and 8am Thursday.

Do NOT be in a manufactured or mobile home this afternoon or tonight. If a
tornado warning is issued go to the lowest, most inside part of your home
without windows.

Rainfall amounts will range from 1.5" to 3.5". There are already a number of
river flood warnings in effect through Friday in anticipation of the heavy rain.

Thursday we will clear out through the morning with the high reaching 67.

Friday will be cooler and windy with winds from the north at 15-20 mph and temps
ranging from 49 to 58.

The weekend will be dry and sport lows in the 30s with highs in the low 60s.
