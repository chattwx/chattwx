Happy Halloween weekend! We will kick off the weekend with scattered on and off
showers throughout much of your Saturday. It will not be a washout, but some
areas could squeeze out up to a quarter of an inch of rainfall. Temperatures
will hold steady in the low to mid-50s all day, making for another cool late
October day. Rain chances will dwindle during the evening hours with skies
gradually clearing overnight.

Sunday will feature much nicer weather as skies continue to clear during the
day. Temperatures will top out in the mid-60s and gradually fall back into the
50s as the kiddos head out the door for trick-or-treating.

Pleasant weather will continue through the middle of the week before our next
weather maker arrives towards the end of the week. This system will bring our
next rain chances plus much cooler temperatures. In fact, we could be dealing
with our first frost of the season heading into next weekend!
