Good morning, the trend of warm weather will persist through Saturday with each
days' highs in the low 70s with the exception of Friday in the upper 60s.
Mornings will generally be mild, too, with many days beginning in the low 60s. 

Now, onto our rain and storm potential,Tuesday will have scattered showers,
especially at midday into the afternoon.

Wednesday will be a Storm Alert Weather Day. Our entire area is now under a
Level 2 Slight risk for scattered severe storms possible. All modes of severe
weather are on the table: damaging wind gusts, hail, and an isolated tornado.
Prepare now to know your storm safety plan and how you'll receive alerts. Timing
: Pockets of heavy rain and storms in the morning (not expecting severe
weather), a break period with little activity in the afternoon, strong to severe
storms at night from 8pm to 4am ET. This window may still change, but as of now,
it does include times when many will be asleep.

Thursday's rain will end in the morning with not much happening for the rest of
the day. Friday will again have scattered showers. Then, the weekend will be
another key time to watch with widespread rain on Saturday and Sunday. Rain
totals at that point will be at 2.5-4", locally 5"+. Localized flooding will be
a concern. There are still a lot of weekend uncertainties as far as severe
weather and possible backside wintry mix with the cold air. We'll dive deeper
into those details once we get through Wednesday night and Thursday morning, but
make a mental note for an active weather weekend.
