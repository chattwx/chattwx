Sunshine will be with us for a few hours. This will help temperatures warm to
the mid to upper 50s before the cold front arrives this evening around 5PM-6PM.

A Winter Storm Warning has replaced the Watch for SE Monroe county. There 3" to
6" of snow will be possible tonight and early Thursday.

For most of us, this will be a rain event, while the mix starts up around 6PM to
8PM and ends by 10PM along the Cumberland Plateau. Flurries will be possible
overnight. Snow amounts on the grass of 1/2" to 2" possible in northern Grundy,
Sequatchie, and Bledsoe counties, too.

The winds will do us a favor tonight for roads. Gusting 20-30 mph, this will
evaporate moisture. Surface road temperatures do not fall to 32 or colder until
early Thursday-therefore I don't expect much black ice tomorrow morning, perhaps
a few slick spots in the higher elevations. The wind chill will be the weather
story early tomorrow. The wind chill drops to 32-33° by 8PM tonight, then near
20-22° by 8AM Thursday morning. The wind chill looks to stay in the 20s all
morning tomorrow, too.

TODAY:

12PM: P. Cloudy, Mild 53

3PM: Clouds increasing west, 56

6PM: Cold front arrives. Wintry mix begins west, 49
