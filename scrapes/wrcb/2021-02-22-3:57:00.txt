Good Monday. Grab the umbrella this morning. You will have rain showers on and
off through about 10am. Wet roads will be the biggest issue. I don't expect any
flooding problems at all. This afternoon will be stunning. We will have sunny
skies with highs around 60 degrees.

The weather gets even better Tuesday and Wednesday with sunshine and highs
reaching the mid to upper 60s!

Thursday we will reach the upper 50s with mostly cloudy skies and a few spotty
showers.

A mild, rainy pattern sets up Friday through the weekend. Highs will be in the
upper 50s and low 60s with rain showers likely Friday through next Monday. Right
now it looks like we may get more than 2" of rain during that time period.
