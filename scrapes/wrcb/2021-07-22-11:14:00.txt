Friday will again be hot, humid, and hazy. Highs will reach the low 90s with the
heat index soaring to the mid-90s. We will have a full "buck" moon Friday night.

We may have a shower or two over the weekend, but the main feature will continue
to be the hot mugginess. Highs will reach 93 Saturday and 92 Sunday.

Rain chances increase a little Monday and Tuesday, but we will still be muggy
with highs around 90.

We will crank the heat up another level the second half of next week. Highs will
make it to the mid-90s, and heat index values will climb to about 100 degrees.
