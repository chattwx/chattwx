I hope everyone has had a great weekend! Skies will remain mostly cloudy for the
remainder of your Sunday. Temperatures will gradually fall from the lower-80s to
the 70s late this evening. An approaching cold front will spark scattered
downpours and a few thunderstorms as we head into the overnight hours. Rainfall
amounts will not be overly impressive, but a few locations may squeeze out a
quick inch of rainfall. The cold front will push to our south by tomorrow
morning, ending rain chances by about 9 AM. The rest of your Labor Day will
feature clearing skies and comfortable temperatures in the low to mid-80s.

Monday through Wednesday will feature high temperatures ranging from 84-88
degrees with tolerable humidity levels. A few showers will be around during the
afternoon hours with the best rain chance coming Wednesday. A reinforcing cold
front will bring a refreshing blast of fall-like air to wrap up the week.
