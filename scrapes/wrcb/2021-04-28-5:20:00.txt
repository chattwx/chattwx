Good Wednesday. We are off to a warm start and we will only get warmer as we
move through the day. The high will reach a whopping 86 this afternoon, 2
degrees shy of the record high of 88 set in 1957. Skies today will be partly to
mostly cloudy.

Thursday we will have similar weather with temps ranging from 65 to 85 under
mostly cloudy skies. It will be breezy, though with winds from the south at
10-20 mph.

We will see rain moving in after 8 pm through the overnight. I expect about 1/2"
of rain. Skies will start clearing out Friday morning after 7 am, and the rest
of Friday should be amazing with sunshine and highs in the mid-70s.

Saturday also looks great with sunshine and a high of 78. Sunday we will have
more clouds and a few late showers with a high of 80.
