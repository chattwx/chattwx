Good Monday. Moving through the evening we will have cloudy skies with an
occasional shower or rumble of thunder, but they will be few and far between.

Tuesday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. Your morning commute will be fine, but
from late morning through the early evening we will have strong scattered storms
moving through. These storms will have a likelihood of producing damaging 60+mph
winds and hail. Isolated tornadoes are also a possibility. Have your severe
weather plan ready to go Tuesday! Heavy rain in excess of 2" is also possible in
some areas so flooding can't be ruled out.

Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday we will clear out and have a great day with a
few clouds and a high of 72.

Thursday another weak front may bring a few afternoon showers, but by Friday we
are dry again with sunshine and a high of 72.

Sunny and 79 Saturday with a few showers and storms and 82 Sunday.
