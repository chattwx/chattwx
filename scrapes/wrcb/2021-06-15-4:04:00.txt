It's still a bit humid outside this Tuesday morning, but much better than
yesterday. As we go through the day, moisture levels will continue to take a
dive, meaning you can expect it to feel more comfortable outside. Today will be
sunny with only a stray cloud. Highs will be from 83-88 for most locations with
a north breeze. Afternoon wind gusts possible at 25-30mph.

Then, tonight will be mostly clear with lows in the upper 50s to low 60s.

The relief from humidity and pleasant June weather will continue on Wednesday
and Thursday. Lots of sunshine both days with highs in near 86 and 88,
respectively. By Friday, it'll be hot again, although the humidity won't be as
bad as recent days. Expect highs in the low 90s and a mostly sunny sky. 

New data have the weekend trending drier with only a 20% chance for an isolated
shower/storm on Saturday and Father's Day with temps in the upper 80s to 90.
Rain chances then increase for Monday of next week. Check back for weekend
updates because it'll depend on a potential tropical system in the SW Gulf of
Mexico. Thus, the track and timing will likely still change.
