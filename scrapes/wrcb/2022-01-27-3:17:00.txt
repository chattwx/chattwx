Thursday is kicking off with very cold temperatures in the 20s and a few spots
in the teens. Thankfully, the wind is not as strong as yesterday, but you'll
still want to grab the winter coat. Today will be mostly sunny, and temperatures
will rebound with warmer highs in the low 50s. Clouds will increase tonight, and
it won't be as cold, staying near the freezing point.

Friday will have mostly cloudy to cloudy skies and highs in the low 40s. A cold
front will pass our area, bringing a chance for scattered light rain to snow
showers. The potential for flurries and light snow showers is primarily for the
higher elevations, especially our eastern mountain communities. At this time,
any accumulations look to be minimal (dusting to 1") with limited to minor
impacts. A few of the highest peaks of Cherokee, Polk, Monroe, Murray, and
Fannin Counties may reach 1-2".

The bigger story, as it will affect everyone, will be the frigid air for Friday
night into Saturday morning. Widespread lows from 12-20Â° are expected, and highs
on Saturday will only be in the mid-30s. Saturday will at least have a mostly
sunny sky. Sunday will range from low 20s in the morning to upper 40s-50 in the
afternoon. Monday will also be mostly sunny with highs near 54.
