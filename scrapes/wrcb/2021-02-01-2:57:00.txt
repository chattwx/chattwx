Very light snow has begun in the higher elevations of Grundy and northern
Sequatchie counties. Snow showers will increase this morning, leading to slick
roads and light snow accumulation in the higher elevations. Amounts of 1" to 2"
are certainly possible from Altamont and in northern Sequatchie, and west
Bledsoe county.

By 6AM-7AM another band is going to set up east of I-75. This band could bring a
dusting to I-75 where 1/2" to 1" is possible. Those in the higher elevations
from eastern Polk through Cherokee, Blue Ridge, and Monroe county could get 1"
to 3"by this evening. Those in the higher elevations of Monroe county will get
5" to 7" by tonight.

It will be a windy day,too, with sustain winds of 10-15 gusting 20-25. A wind
chill in the 20s will be ongoing for most of the day.

Plan for a slow go this morning, especially west of I-75 during morning drive
time.

TODAY:

6AM: Light snow west, 36 (Wind Chill 30)

9AM: Light snow showers, 35 (Wind Chill 28)

12PM: Light snow showers, 36 (wind chill 29)
