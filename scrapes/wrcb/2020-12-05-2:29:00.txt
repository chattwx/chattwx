This nice December weather will continue right into the evening hours,
cooperating well for the couple of Christmas parades happening tonight.
Generally speaking, it'll be in the 50s when you're waiting for the parade to
start (5:00), but after sunset and during the parade, it'll be in the 40s.
Overnight will have scattered clouds with lows around freezing in Chattanooga
and below freezing outside of the city. Cherokee County expect low 20s.

Sunday will be partly sunny and highs near 54. Clouds will increase more in the
evening with a chance for a few light, isolated showers. Isolated showers on
Monday, too, and the higher elevations may see a few snow flurries. Highs will
only be in the mid-40s. Tuesday will become sunny with highs near 49. Wednesday
and Thursday will be sunny with only a few high clouds and in the mid-50s and
near 60, respectively. The work week will end with broken cloud cover and highs
around 60 on Friday. Showers will then start-up Friday night with rain on
Saturday.
