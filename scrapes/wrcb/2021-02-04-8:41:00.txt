Clouds will persist today with winds increasing in the afternoon. This is a
south wind, which means lows tonight will be above freezing in the mid to upper
30s.

A Wind Advisory is valid at 4PM today through 2AM Friday morning for Bledsoe,
Marion, Sequatchie, east Monroe, and east Polk counties. Sustained south winds
will increase this evening around 20-30 mph, gusting near 40-50. Those in the
way higher elevations of Monroe county, could get a wind gust close to 70! A few
isolated power outages will be possible.

Rain moves in tonight. Due to the south wind, this event should be all liquid,
resulting in 0.10" to .25" in Chattanooga, to perhaps 0.50" in the higher
elevations west near the Cumberland Plateau. A very small window exists for
flurries over the Blue Ridge Mountains Friday morning, but that's about it. Rain
will exit early Friday morning around 7AM, and mostly before morning drive time.

THIS WEEKEND:

Saturday during the day will be dry. Temperatures will reach 50-52 in the
afternoon under partly cloudy skies. Not as much of a wind with this weekend's
weather maker, rain moves in late Saturday, about 9PM or so, transitions to a
wintry mix early Sunday morning. The weather maker will move out by 8AM-9AM
Sunday morning, leaving a dry and cooler Sunday afternoon. It's possible for a
dusting in the higher elevations. This would include the Cumberland Plateau, the
Blue Ridge Mtns, and east of I-75 for Polk, Cherokee, and Monroe counties. Stay
tuned as new model data comes in for Saturday night.

TODAY:

12PM: M. Cloudy, 39

3PM M. Cloudy, 49

6PM: M. Cloud, 48 (south winds pick up)
