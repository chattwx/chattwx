Happy Sunday, everyone! It's a warm morning with temperatures starting off in
the upper 50s & lower 60s. But don't get to used to those numbers today, cold
air is heading our way! In fact, our Sunday is a Storm Alert Weather Day! While
severe storms are NOT expected today, a low pressure brings more rain to the
area late this afternoon thru tonight. This system has trended stronger and
slower over the past 24 hours. As such, it gives the entire area a better chance
at not only seeing the rain change to snow tonight, but a chance for some light
accumulations in the valley areas, and a few inches possible in the mountains &
higher elevations. A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for most of the
area for this evening & tonight.

Right now, the timing of the transition from rain to snow looks to be around
7-9pm for the Plateau, 9-11pm for Valley locations, and eastern communities. A
few hour period of heavy wet snow seems likely, which could accumulate
especially on grassy and elevated surfaces. As temperatures drop near or below
freezing overnight, a few slick spots could become an issue for our Monday
morning commute.

We will get a brief break in the active weather this week with a COLD Monday,
followed by moderating temps Tuesday & Wednesday afternoon. Our next weather
maker arrives by Thursday bringing a chance for showers, followed by more arctic
air. We will need to watch the amount of moisture available behind that front
for another shot at some wintry weather.

Have a great Sunday!
