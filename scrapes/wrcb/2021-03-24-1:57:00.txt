A powerful storm system is developing in the southern plains today. The energy
from this storm will be moving our way overnight and into Thursday. So, we will
start to see more clouds moving in especially later tonight and through
Thursday. A few showers or an isolated storm could develop in the pre-dawn
hours. But the main event will be later in the day. Lows should be in the upper
50's.

Thursday will be a Storm Alert Day. As the system closes in on us, showers and
storms will start popping. Any one of which could turn severe. Winds will be out
of the south at 10 to 15 mph, but there will be stronger gusts especially in the
storms. Highs will be in the mid-'70s.

The main event will be in the evening hours as the cold front approaches. The
Storm Prediction Center has placed us in an area that has a good potential for
severe storms and tornadoes. So, everyone should be prepared to take cover if a
tornado warning is issued for your area. Know where to go in the event a tornado
heads your way! Rainfall will be heavy, too. I am expecting at least 1 to inches
and possibly 3 to 4 in isolated areas!

By 1 AM Friday morning, the worst of the weather will be leaving our area.
Friday should turn partly cloudy with highs in the mid-'70s. Saturday and Sunday
will see the return of showers and possibly a few storms. I am not expecting
severe weather this weekend.

Monday should be dry and cooler with highs in the 60's. More rain and possibly
some storms could return for Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. Paul Barys
