Severe thunderstorms and a few strong tornadoes will develop tonight all across
the Tennessee Valley. By midnight the threat will weaken quickly. Make sure you
have a plan to go to a safe place where you live in case of a tornado warning.
Flash flooding will be a possibility, for the next 12 hours, too! Skies will be
clearing on Friday and winds will lighten. Highs should be in the mid 70's.

On Saturday and Sunday, we will see more showers and storms. There is a chance
some of the storms on Saturday could be strong to severe. Highs on Saturday will
be in the mid 70's and Sunday will be cooler with highs near 70.

Monday will be sunny and pleasant with highs in the 60's. Tuesday through
Thursday will see light rain showers, and highs in near 70 on Tuesday, and in
the 60's next Wednesday and Thursday. Paul Barys
