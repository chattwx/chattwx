Good Thursday. We have seen spotty storms with highs in the low 90s today. It
will remain muggy with an isolated shower or storm this evening. Temps will be
dropping through the low 80s into the upper 70s this evening.

Friday through Monday will be a stable weather pattern. We will remain hot and
humid with highs around 90. Each day we MIGHT see a pop-up storm or two, but the
chance is very low.

I am watching the path of the tropical depression in the Caribbean to
potentially bring us some solid rain Tuesday and Wednesday. Rainfall amounts are
really up in the air, but a 2" rainfall total during those two days seems like a
reasonable possibility pending a change in the track.

Thursday and Friday actually look pretty good. We will dry out, temps will be in
the low to mid-80s, and the humidity will be just a bit lower as well.
