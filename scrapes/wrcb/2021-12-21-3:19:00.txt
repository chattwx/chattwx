Good morning and happy Winter Solstice. Today is the shortest day of the year.
After today, we'll slowly start gaining a few seconds of sunlight each day, and
by the middle of January, sunlight will be increasing by over a minute per day.
Not only is today the first day of the astronomical winter season, it's also
going to feel like winter outside. Chilly this morning in the 30s, expect a
cloudy to mostly cloudy sky with highs only in the mid to upper 40s. A couple of
isolated showers will be possible, too. Tonight, clouds will break up for a
partly cloudy sky and lows in the upper 20s to low 30s.

Wednesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the upper 40s to 50. The sunshine
will continue on Thursday in the mid-50s. Friday will be partly sunny and mild
in the low 60s. Chances are now decreasing for rain showers on Christmas Eve
night to only isolated spots now. Christmas day will be warm at 65 with some
sunshine but also a spotty shower chance. The mild temps will continue on Sunday
at 64 and partly sunny. For the latest, download the WRCB weather app.
