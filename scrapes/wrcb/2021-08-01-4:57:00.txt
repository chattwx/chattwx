Tonight will feature partly cloudy skies with low temperatures ranging from
63-68 degrees.

The haze will be thick again on Monday as smoke from western wildfires moves
over the Tennessee Valley. Otherwise, skies will be mostly sunny with high
temperatures climbing into the mid to upper-80s. The humidity will be much more
tolerable to begin the week.

Tuesday through Friday will feature high temperatures ranging from 84-89 degrees
and overnight lows in the 60s each night. The best chance of afternoon storms
looks to be Wednesday and Thursday. The overall pattern places most of the
heavier rain just off to our south and east through the next 6-7 days.

The heat and humidity will build heading into the weekend as temperatures return
to the 90s.
