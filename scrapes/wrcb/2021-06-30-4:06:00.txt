Get out and enjoy the comfortable temperatures this morning because we have a
hot and muggy day ahead. It'll be in the mid-80s at noon with a heat index
around 90. Then, afternoon highs will reach the upper 80s to low 90s. Topping
out near 92 in Chattanooga with a heat index of 95. Expect a mostly sunny sky
through lunch and then partly cloudy for the afternoon. Today, there will only
be a few spotty afternoon/evening pop-up showers - very minimal. Tonight will be
partly cloudy in the upper 60s to low 70s.

Thursday will become mostly cloudy with scattered showers/storms. Highs will be
in the mid-80s. The coverage of rain will increase heading into the night hours,
and then a heavy batch of rain and storms will move through during Friday
morning, starting before sunrise and continuing through about midday from west
to east. Plan for a wet morning commute or if you're starting the holiday
weekend early, it may be slow-go on the interstates.

The good news is that the 4th of July weekend is looking very nice. Mostly sunny
with lower humidity on both Saturday and Sunday with highs near 85 and 87,
respectively.
