Mostly cloudy to cloudy skies will continue for the next few days, but the
chance for any significant rain will remain remote through the weekend. The
pattern that is developing will let upper air moisture continue to move in, but
the lower levels where we live will remain relatively dry so rain will have to
wait for a while.

Lows tonight should be in the '50s and highs on Friday will be in the mid-'70s.
A sprinkle may develop north of the city Friday night but any amounts will be
very light. Lows should be in the mid-'50s.

This weekend will continue to be cloudy with highs in the low 70's on Saturday
and upper 70's on Sunday. Monday will remain cloudy with highs near 70. By
Monday night showers will move in with rain likely Tuesday. Highs Tuesday will
be in the low 70's.

Wednesday will see showers again especially late in the day with highs in the
mid-'70s. Thursday looks wet early with cooler highs in the mid-'60s. Paul Barys
