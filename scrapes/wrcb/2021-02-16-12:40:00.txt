Some of the coldest air of the season will settle in for tonight. Lows will drop
to near 20 in the city and teens elsewhere. Skies will be partly to mostly
cloudy. Clouds will be on the increase again for Wednesday as highs climb into
the mid-'40s. Wednesday night, another round of wintry mix will move in with
lows dropping into the mid-'30s in the city but near-freezing elsewhere. There
could be some slick conditions in the higher elevations of the Cumberland
Plateau. On Thursday the wintry mix will change to rain and over an inch of rain
will be possible.

Friday will see a gradual clearing with highs in the low 40's. Saturday morning
will be cold with low 20's expected. Saturday should be sunny with highs in the
upper 40's. Sunday will be partly cloudy with highs in the mid to upper 50's.

Another round of showers could develop next Monday with highs in the upper 50's.
Tuesday will be sunny with the upper 50's again. Paul Barys
