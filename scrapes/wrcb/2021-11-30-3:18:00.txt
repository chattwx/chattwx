Good morning, we have another freezing start to the day, but from here, we begin
a warming trend for the rest of the work-week. Bundle up this morning, and then
expect mild temperatures in the afternoon around 60. It'll be a sunny day with a
few passing clouds late afternoon into the evening. Tonight will have increasing
clouds with lows from 35-40 for most.

Wednesday will have a mix of sun and clouds with highs in the mid-60s. Thursday
will bump up to the upper 60s and mostly sunny. Then, Friday will top out at 70
with a mostly sunny to partly cloudy sky.

Saturday will have more clouds with highs dropping a bit to 65. There will be a
chance for a few isolated showers. Sunday will be similar with a couple of
spotty showers and highs in the low 60s. Certainly not a big concern for rain
this week, but something to keep an eye on for long term outdoor plans.
