Good Tuesday. It will be a chilly and breezy one today. Definitely have a jacket
this morning, and crank the seat warmer up to "2". Temps are in the 30s starting
out. We even made it into the 20s in the Blue Ridge. This afternoon look for a
high of only 58 with winds from the NW at 10-15 mph. Skies will be sunny all
day.

We will get even colder tonight with the low dropping to 33 in Chattanooga.
Outside the city we will be freezing or below, even falling into the low 20s in
the mountains! It will be sunny and cool Wednesday afternoon with highs in the
upper 50s.

Thursday and Friday we will show some gradual warming. Thursday temps will range
from 35 in the morning to 62 in the afternoon. Friday we will go from 39 to 69.
Skies will be sunny both days.

We will be mostly sunny Saturday with cloudy skies Sunday. Highs will be around
70 both days.

Another front will bring light rain showers Monday and possibly Tuesday of next
week.

Hurricane Iota made landfall Central America, and is now a category 2 storm. It
will continue to move west producing flooding rains through tomorrow.
