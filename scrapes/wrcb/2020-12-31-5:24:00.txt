Good Thursday and Happy New Year's Eve! We are wrapping up 2020 with warm and
cloudy weather all day. we will climb into the upper 50s and low 60s this
afternoon. With the clouds, we may get a stray sprinkle or two, but the rain
chance today is only 20%. That includes midnight. As we roll into 2021 it will
be in the mid 50s, cloudy, and maybe one or two sprinkles. We will not
accumulate more than 1/10" today.

Expect showers to move through overnight into Friday morning. Friday will be a
Storm Alert Weather Dayas we see some thunderstorms moving through between 6am
and 2pm. The risk of severe weather is low, but isolated areas of damaging wind
and even a pop up tornado can not be ruled out. Rain amounts will range from .5"
to 1.5". We will remain warm with highs in the low to mid-60s. Remnant showers
will taper off through the late afternoon and evening.

Saturday will be warm and dry. Temps will range from 48 in the morning to 63 in
the afternoon. I do think we will see a few showers in the Blue Ridge Saturday
night. Sunday will be a little cooler with the high only reaching 51.
