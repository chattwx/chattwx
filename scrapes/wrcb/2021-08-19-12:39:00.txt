With the late night storms calming overnight we can focus on Thursday.

We do have two River Flood Warnings. One for the Coahulla Creek and one for the
Conasauga River until 6:30am. They are both right at flood stage.

Thursday we will start with cloudy skies and maybe a few isolated showers.
During the afternoon, however, we can expect widespread rain and thunderstorms.
Some of the rain will produce heavy downpours of an inch or more.

Friday and Saturday will be humid with highs in the mid-80s and a few afternoon
showers or storms.

Sunday rain chances really drop to near zero as high pressure builds in. We will
start up a hot, muggy pattern Sunday through at least next Wednesday with no
rain and highs in the humid low 90s.
