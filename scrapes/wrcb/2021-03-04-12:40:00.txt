If March ends up being a quiet month in the weather department, you won't have
any complaints here.

Once again, it will be a tranquil evening to be outside on the patio, take the
bike out, and play with the kids. Temperatures look to be in the mid 60s at 6PM
with a very light northeast wind of 5-6 mph. It will also be a nice evening
before sunset, to hit the green.

A few clouds will increase tonight, but most will be clear. It will still be
cold in the mid to upper 30s overnight. Look for more clouds Friday, not quite
as tranquil, but still nice with highs in the low 60s.

It will be cooler this weekend. Temperatures look to top 60-61 and nights will
be near freezing. It's trending warmer next week though! For many of our boaters
itching to be out on the water, a week from now, upper 70s to near 80 is
possible!

For those looking to start planting in the vegetable garden, Carrots, Radishes,
and Spinach look to be good to start planting outside next week. Broccoli and
Lettuce can be started inside now.

TONIGHT:

6PM: 64 M. Clear

9PM: 57, M. Clear

12AM: 52, M. Clear
