The biggest weather worry for today will be patchy dense river valley fog. It
won't be widespread, but if you drive on a road near a river, you may run into
some reduced visibility this morning through about 8am. Then, the rest of your
Monday is smooth sailing for weather. It'll be a sunny day with wind shifting
out of the south at 5-10mph for the afternoon. Highs will be in the upper 70s to
80. Some clouds will move into the area late afternoon into the evening, making
for a partly cloudy sky tonight with lows in the mid-50s.

Tuesday will have a mix of sun and clouds with highs in the low 80s. Wednesday
will be partly sunny to mostly cloudy at times and still warm in the low 80s.
Thursday will be mostly cloudy with PM showers, highs around 80. Those showers
will continue into Friday morning. Friday will also be cooler with a high of 73.
Then, the weekend will be mostly sunny. Highs near 74 on Saturday and 78 on
Sunday.
