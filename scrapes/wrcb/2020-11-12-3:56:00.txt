Good Thursday. The rains have moved on, and we are left with cloudy skies this
morning. The clouds will clear through the day, and we will enjoy an amazing
afternoon with sunshine and highs around 70. Tonight will be much cooler,
dropping into the mid to upper 40s by Friday morning.

Friday afternoon will be another stellar fall day with sunshine and a high of
70.

Saturday looks great with mostly sunshine and temps ranging from 43 in the
morning to 70 in the afternoon.

Another front will move through Sunday. It looks like the best chance for rain
with this front will be a few showers Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon we will
dry out and temps will start dropping.

Next week will start much cooler with highs around 60 and lows dropping into the
low 40s Monday morning and mid to upper 30s Tuesday morning.

After Sunday we will be sunny and dry all next week.

In the tropics:

-Tropical Storm Eta is making landfall this morning along the Florida gulf coast
with 50 mph winds and flooding rains mainly south of the storm.

-Tropical Storm Theta continues to move east through the Atlantic away from the
U.S.

-An area of interest in the Caribbean now has a 90% chance for developing into a
tropical depression and possibly becoming Tropical Storm Iota this weekend.
