Good Wednesday. The heat is on! This evening we will have temps in the low 90s
as late as 8pm, then drop through the 80s the rest of the night. Skies will be
clear, but there is still some minor smoke in the air from western wildfires.

Thursday will again be hot and sunny. Highs will be in the upper 90s, and we
will flirt with 100 in Chattanooga as the high reaches 99.

Friday we will hit 97 with sunny skies until late in the day when a weak front
will slide down from the north and possibly give us a shower or two. the heat
index both Thursday and Friday will climb to between 100 and 105.

Saturday will be dry, but we will also have the high reaching a muggy 94.

We will finally get some relief Sunday with showers on and off through the day
and a high of 85.

Next week we will stay in a pattern of cooler highs in the mid 80s and a decent
chance for showers and storms each afternoon. We should also enjoy some slightly
lower humidity next week.
