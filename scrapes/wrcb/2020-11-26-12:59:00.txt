After a beautiful Thanksgiving Day, skies will be mostly clear tonight with lows
in the low 40's. A few high clouds will move in for Friday, but temperatures
will remain well above normal and in the mid to upper 60's. Saturday will
continue pleasant with mostly sunny skies and highs in the mid 60's.

Sunday will see the clouds increasing and by late in the day, more than likely
by night, showers will move in and some of the rain could become heavy. The rain
will continue on Monday with a slow changeover to a mix of rain and snow. The
snow should not be anything more than flurries. Colder air will fly in with
temperatures only in the low to mid 40's by afternoon.

Tuesday will continue chilly with highs near 40 to the low 40's. But skies will
be clearing off. Wednesday should be sunny and cool with highs near 50. Paul
