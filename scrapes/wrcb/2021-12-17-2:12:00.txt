Good Friday! After lots of clouds and misty showers today, we will see overcast
skies and warm temps continue through the evening with temps in the low 60s. We
will see some showers overnight into Saturday morning, then through the day
Saturday, we will have periods of heavy rain, scattered showers, and a few
rumbles of thunder. No severe weather is expected, however, we could see some
localized flooding as 1" to 2" of rain will be possible through the day.

The rain will taper off Saturday night, but a stray shower may linger into early
Sunday morning. Sunday will be much colder, starting at 44 and only climbing to
50! Next week will remain seasonably cold with lows in the low 30s and highs in
the mid-50s through Thursday.

Next Friday is Christmas Eve, and it looks like we will warm a bit to 59 in the
afternoon. We may get a few rain showers at night, but right now it looks as
though we will have a warm Christmas with temps ranging from 47 in the morning
to 63 in the afternoon under partly cloudy skies. Stay tuned. It's still a long
way off. Still, plenty of time to pray for snow!!
