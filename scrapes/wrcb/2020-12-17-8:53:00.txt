It will be the coldest afternoon this week-as highs stay 10-15 below normal near
40-42 this afternoon. Most of the Tennessee Valley won't make it out of the 30s!

Expect flurries through early afternoon, too.

The sunshine will peek out late afternoon, and tonight will be clear and cold.
Overnight will drop to the 20s-making a frigid start to Friday.

Sunshine returns tomorrow with highs near 50.

Next little system moves in early Sunday morning and tapers off Sunday evening.
Very light rain is expected Sunday, where 0.01" to 0.12" total looks possible.

Preliminary data is indicating a good dosage of rain arriving as Santa delivers
gifts on Thursday night next week. Rain, heavy at times, is looking possible for
Christmas Eve. This would also mean, colder temperatures for Christmas Day and
into the following weekend.

TODAY:

12PM: Cold with flurries, 38

3PM: Cold, 40

6PM: Clouds clearing, 37
