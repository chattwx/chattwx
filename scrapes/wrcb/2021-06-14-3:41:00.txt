Good Monday. It is a hot, muggy one today with temps in the low 90s and the heat
index knocking on 100. If we can get through today, however, some relief is
around the corner.

Tonight we will see our humidity levels beginning to drop as skies become clear
and our lows drop to about 70 in Chattanooga. Tuesday afternoon will be much
more comfortable with highs in the mid to upper 80s and much lower humidity.
Skies will be sunny all day.

We will be cooler Wednesday morning in the low 60s, and with the lower humidity,
it should feel really nice in the morning. The afternoon will be in the upper
80s and sunny.

Thursday we will make it back to about 90 after another pleasant morning in the
low 60s.

By Friday we will start great with a morning low of about 64, but we shoot up to
94 in the afternoon. The humidity should still be low enough so it won't be
completely oppressive.

Over the weekend the humidity will be back with temps Saturday ranging from 71
to 87. We will get a few showers and storms Saturday.

Sunday will be a day to watch. Storms will be more likely.[

There are a few areas developing in the tropics. Tropical Depression #2 is off
the North Carolina coast, and a tropical low in the Bay of Campeche is likely to
develop and move north later this week.
