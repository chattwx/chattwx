Good Morning,

days which is over Jackson County.

Dense fog is expected to increase through 8AM CDT/9AM EDT. While there is
currently not a Dense Fog Advisory, there may be one issued later this morning.

Temperatures will warm to the mid 80s today - feeling much more like a June day.
This weekend, it heats up, as temperatures reach 90 on Saturday. An isolated
shower is possible Saturday evening, while there is a better rain and
thunderstorm chance for Sunday. Plan to be out and about on the water Saturday,
but keep an eye on radar, Sunday.
