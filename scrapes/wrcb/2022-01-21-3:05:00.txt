Good Friday! Protect the pipes, pets, and people tonight. Temps will be falling
through the low 30s this evening and dropping all the way to the low 20s by
Saturday morning. On the Cumberland Plateau, I expect it to drop into the
mid-10s.

Both Saturday and Sunday will sport cold mornings in the low 20s with the highs
climbing into the chilly mid-40s.

Monday will be a little warmer in the afternoon climbing to 52.

Another front will bring a chilly afternoon rain Tuesday followed by another
cool down mid-week.

Wednesday we will only warm to 38 for a high.

Thursday and Friday will have cold mornings in the 20s with highs only in the
low 40s.
