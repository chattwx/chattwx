Happy Saturday! Temperatures will fall back into the 40s this evening under
mostly clear skies. Skies will become cloudy overnight, with a few showers
possible after 3 AM. Lows will range from 37-41 degrees.

Our next weather maker will move in after sunrise on Sunday in the form of RAIN!
The wet weather will continue for much of the day, gradually tapering off Sunday
evening between 6-7 PM. 1-2" of rainfall will fall across the area, with locally
higher amounts possible in the higher elevations. A few rumbles of thunder may
accompany the rain, but any severe threat will likely remain confined to the
Gulf Coast region.

We will start the work week with plenty of sunshine and chilly daytime
temperatures in the 40s. Highs will return to normal by the end of the week,
with minimal rain chances through Friday.
