Good Wednesday, and happy Veterans Day. Expect some wet roads and leaves all
over the car and driveway as you head out this morning. On and off rain showers
will continue through the afternoon, ending as we head through the evening into
the late night. Rainfall amounts will be widely varied, from 1/4" up to an inch.
Temps will remain warm throughout the day, topping out at 76 this afternoon.

The front bringing the rain will move east and usher in cooler, dry weather
Thursday through the weekend. Highs will be in the low 70s, and the humidity
will be dropping. Lows will be cooler in the 40s and low 50s.

Another front will bring some light showers to the area early Monday morning. We
will clear out through the day as much cooler air moves in. Highs Monday will be
in the low 60s. Lows next week will drop into the mid to upper 30s.

In the tropics:

-Tropical Storm Eta will make landfall Thursday along the "big bend" portion of
the Florida coast.
-Tropical Storm Theta is in the Atlantis, but moving away from the U.S.

-An area of interest in the Caribbean has an 80% chance of developing into a
tropical storm within the next 5 days.
