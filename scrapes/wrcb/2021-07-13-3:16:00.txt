Good Tuesday. We will see some spotty areas of rain and maybe a few storms
through the evening hours. The main threat will be from heavy rain producing
localized flooding. Temps this evening will be in the upper 70s and low 80s.

Wednesday and Thursday will sport very little rain and we may even see a little
bit of sunshine returning. With that, we will be hot and humid with the highs
near 90 and the heat index in the low to mid 90s both days.

Friday will still sport a high of about 90, but we will have better chances for
scattered storms in the afternoon and evening as a front slowly slides through.

Temps will drop over the weekend into the mid 80s with increased chances for
mainly afternoon showers and storms both Saturday and Sunday.
