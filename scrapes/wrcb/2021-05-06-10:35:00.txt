Good Thursday night. Gusty winds knocked out power to some, and did damage to
some property around the Tennessee Valley tonight. A dying front created the
winds as it moved through. We will calm down overnight, but may see some clouds
hanging around. 

Friday morning in the mid to upper 40s. We may have the clouds linger long
enough to help keep morning lows a little higher so we may only drop to the low
50s in Chattanooga. Friday will be cool, sunny, and breezy all day as the high
only reaches 69.

Saturday will be partly cloudy and cool again with temps ranging from 49 to 71
in Chattanooga. There is a very slight chance for a shower around lunchtime, but
most will see nothing.

Mother's Day will be warmer with morning temps in the 50s and afternoon highs
climbing to about 80. We will get some showers, but not until late Sunday night
into Monday morning.

Next week will sport varying chances for rain through the week.
