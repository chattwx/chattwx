Happy Monday, everyone! Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day! While widespread
severe weather is NOT expected, widespread rain & a few rumbles will be likely,
especially between 9am-2pm. Some of the rainfall could be locally heavy and
cause some impacts to our morning and early afternoon commutes. Also, once the
front moves through the area this afternoon, a gusty northwest wind will quickly
move in leading to dropping temperatures and blustery conditions for late this
afternoon. High temps will likely occur around mid-morning in the lower 60s, but
will drop into the upper 40s this afternoon once the front blows thru. Make sure
you grab the coats for later today!

Tonight, look for clearing skies and breezy conditions. Overnight lows will drop
down to freezing or below in most locations. Thankfully, the gusty winds should
really help to dry the roadways before that occurs.

Tuesday will a mix of clouds and sunshine. Morning lows will be near freezing,
and daytime highs will only be in the 40s.

A system will graze us to the south on Wednesday, leading to a few showers and
more clouds. Highs will be in the 50s.

Thursday will feature mostly cloudy conditions with highs in the 50s.

Our next weather maker begins to throw some moisture our way on Friday.
Scattered showers will be possible with mostly cloudy skies. A stronger front
arrives on Saturday bringing the risk for widespread showers & storms, followed
by another cool down by next Sunday!

Have a great Monday!
