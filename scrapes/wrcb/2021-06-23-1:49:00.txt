Dry weather will be the rule for the next few days. Warmer temperatures will
move back in, along with higher humidity levels. Thursday will see highs in the
upper 80's and the same will be true for Friday. We will continue to see mostly
sunny skies with just a few passing clouds.

This weekend will see increasing humidity with a chance for isolated showers
Saturday evening and scattered showers or storms Sunday afternoon and evening.
Highs should be in the mid to upper 80's.

Next week will start off with typical summertime weather and highs in the mid to
upper 80's with scattered afternoon and evening storms. Paul Barys
