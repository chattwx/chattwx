Rain has tapered off overnight to only isolated showers. I don't expect any new
flash flooding this morning, but there will be residual effects from yesterday's
rain. Please, use caution driving, especially before sunrise and particularly in
Sequatchie and Bledsoe Counties where the heaviest rain has fallen.

Isolated showers will continue after sunrise in the morning. Then, showers and
storms will increase to scattered to numerous coverage in the afternoon. The
heaviest rainfall today will be for areas along and east of I-75. However, any
additional rainfall in Sequatchie, Bledsoe, Marion, and Grundy Counties today
may create new flooding due to high totals from yesterday. Today will be mostly
cloudy with highs in the mid to upper 70s.

Showers and storms will continue overnight into Friday morning, especially for
areas east. Weather will improve through the day on Friday with decreasing
clouds in the afternoon and highs in the upper 70s to 80. The weekend weather
will be nice with mostly sunny skies and highs around 80. The 80s will continue
into next work-week.
