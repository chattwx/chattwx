Good Tuesday. We will continue to see some pop-up showers and maybe a storm or
two east of Chattanooga. For most, however, it will be another stellar evening
with the humidity staying in check and temps falling from the low 80s into the
70s.

Wednesday will be a repeat for the most part with a high of 85. I do think we
will have a few more scattered showers and storms around the area, though. We
could even see a few in the morning, but primarily in the afternoon.

Thursday and Friday will be a little warmer with highs in the upper 80s. I don't
expect much in the way of rain save one or two very isolated showers or storms
in the afternoon.

The weekend will see us returning to a warm, muggy pattern. Highs will climb
from 89 Saturday to 93 Sunday. Both days may sport a spotty shower or storm. The
humidity will be climbing back up over the weekend as well.

Next week will be hot and muggy. Highs each day will make it to the low 90s.
There is very little in the way of rain for next week.
