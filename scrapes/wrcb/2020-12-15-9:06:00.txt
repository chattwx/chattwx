Enjoy today!

A storm system over Kansas and Texas will truck east, reaching us by tomorrow.
Today highs will be near 50, and with more clouds tonight, lows will be near
39-40.

Light rain arrives 7AM-9AM Wednesday morning. Rainfall totals tomorrow will
range from 0.25" to 0.50" with the highest mounts near the Blue Ridge and Murphy
areas. No flooding is expected.

A few flurries will be possible Wednesday night-Thursday morning, but no snow
accumulation is expected. On both Wednesday and Thursday mornings, in the higher
elevations east near Asheville, minor freezing rain is possible. If you plan on
traveling near Asheville either tomorrow or early Thursday, be mindful of slick
roads during this period. A glaze of ice up to 0.10" will be possible there.

As this system moves out, the coldest morning this week will be Friday as
temperatures drop to the upper 20s. We'll keep an eye on a brief shower this
weekend, too, but rainfall this weekend looks minimal.

12PM: M. Sunny, 44
