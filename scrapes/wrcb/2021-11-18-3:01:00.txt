Good Thursday. The front has moved through, and as the rain tapers to an end and
skies clear out this evening we will have some good chilly fall air settling
over us this weekend.

Friday we will start in the low 30s and climb to only 55. Saturday will be
partly cloudy with temps ranging from 34 to 58.

Sunday another from will approach ahead of which we will actually be a little
warmer. We will start the day at about 40, then climb to 60 for a high. Clouds
will be on the increase, and I would expect some rain showers in the afternoon
into Sunday night.

The cold air returns next week with a high of only 47 Monday. Tuesday and
Wednesday will start cold in the 20s, with both afternoons remaining chilly in
the upper 40s and low 50s.

We can preview Thanksgiving Day now. It looks like we will have partly cloudy
skies with tolerable temps. I am looking at a low of 38 and a high of 55.
