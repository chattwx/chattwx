Happy weekend! Today will be a gorgeous start to the month of May. Sunny skies
this morning will only have a few high, thin clouds for the afternoon. Highs
today will be from 74-78 for most with wind from the northeast in the morning,
becoming variable as the day progresses. A fantastic day from backyards to ball
fields.

Tonight will be partly cloudy with clouds increasing, calm wind, and lows in the
low to mid-50s. Sunday will be mostly cloudy. It'll remain warm with highs
around 77 and dry for most of the day. Spotty shower chances will develop late
afternoon into evening, then increasing during the night. 

The work-week will have a rainy, active pattern. Monday will have times of rain
and storms with highs in the low 80s. Tuesday will be stormy again, especially
in the afternoon and evening. Both Monday and Tuesday PM will need to be watched
for possible strong to severe storms. Wednesday will still have showers and
storms. Finally, on Thursday and Friday, activity will lessen with only isolated
chances and partly cloudy skies. Highs will be cooler in the upper 60s to low
70s.
