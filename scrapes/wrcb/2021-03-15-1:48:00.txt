Showers will move in for tonight along with a few isolated thunderstorms. I am
not expecting any severe weather with this cluster. Lows will be in the
mid-'50s. Tuesday will see cloudy skies with most of the leftover showers south
of the city. Highs should be in the mid to upper 60's.

 

 

Wednesday will see more showers and storms move back into the Tennessee Valley
and some of the storms could turn severe late in the day and into the overnight.
Highs will be near 70. Thursday will see the showers ending and some brief
clearing with more clouds and patches of drizzle throughout the late afternoon
and evening. Highs will be near 70.

Friday should be mostly cloudy with a cooler high in the low 60's. Saturday and
Sunday look dry with highs in the low 60's. Monday should be cloudy and a bit
warmer with highs in the mid to upper 60's. Paul Barys
