Good Thursday. Tonight is the full "strawberry" moon. Although it is also called
the mead moon and the blue corn moon (Have you ever heard the wolf cry...).

Friday will be warm and dry. The humidity will not be terrible, but we will
still make it to the upper 80s. Skies will be mostly sunny.

The weekend will be a muggy one. Temps in the morning will be in the upper 660s
and low 70s. Highs will be in the upper 80s, but it will feel like it is in the
mid-90s. Rain chances are low both days, but I wouldn't count out a stray shower
or storm either afternoon.

The first half of next week will remain hot and humid with highs around 90. Rain
chances will stay pretty low until the end of next week.
