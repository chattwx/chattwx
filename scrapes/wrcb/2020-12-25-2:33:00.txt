Flurries in our TN counties will continue until about 6PM-7PM or so. No
accumulation is expected during this time.

Clouds will erode tonight from west to east becoming clear, and will be colder
overnight near 20. This morning's low was 24.

Saturday will be sunny and cold. A wind chill in the teens is possible before
10AM before a big improvement in the afternoon. While highs only top 42-43
tomorrow, the wind chill will get to the upper 30s.

Sunday, look good too, with sunshine and a high near 50.

Light rain moves in Monday morning, very brief, and very light. A trace to 0.10"
is expected before noon Monday.

Heading into next week, the next system to bring a decent amount of rain, moves
in Wednesday night of next week into Thursday (New Year's Eve). Rain, heavy at
times looks possible, where 1" to 2" is looking good. A brief snow mix will be
possible on New Year's Eve night. I don't see great accumulation, but a dusting
for our Tennessee counties.

TONIGHT:

6PM: Broken Clouds, 27. Wind Chill, 18

9PM: Clear, 23. Wind Chill, 16

12AM: Clear 22. Wind Chill, 16
