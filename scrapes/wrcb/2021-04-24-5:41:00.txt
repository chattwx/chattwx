Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day. First up is simple rain. It will be a soggy
start to your Saturday with widespread rain across the entire area. Rainfall
rates will be moderate to heavy at times with a few rumbles of thunder - nothing
severe. The widespread rain will wrap up by about noon. Then, we'll be in a bit
of a lull period. A few scattered showers/storms will still be possible through
about 2pm along I-75 in Tennessee. The afternoon will have highs near 67. I
think we could see some breaks in clouds, if that happens temps may rise a few
degrees higher. Next, scattered storms will develop from about 5 to 11pm EDT.
These will be the ones with the low-end severe potential. Our Georgia and NE
Alabama counties and Cherokee County in NC are all under a Level 1 Marginal risk
for an isolated severe storm, but everyone should stay weather aware, especially
if you plan to be outside. Primary hazards: hail, strong gusty wind. Lastly,
today will be a windy day. Wind will be shifting out of the east to south at
5-15mph, gusts at 25-35mph. The mountains of SE Monroe County are under a High
Wind Warning for gusts up to 60mph.

Now, we can relax for the rest of the weekend. After midnight, conditions will
quieten down. Lows will range from 45-50. Sunday will have decreasing clouds for
sunshine in the afternoon and highs in the low 70s. Monday will be warmer in the
upper 70s to 80 and mostly sunny. Tuesday will have high clouds and a high of
83.
