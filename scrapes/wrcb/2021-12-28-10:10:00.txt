Happy Tuesday, everyone! We're seeing a mix of clouds and some sunshine around
the area. Temperatures are quickly warming thru the upper 60s into the 70s. We
will be on record watch the next several days, as our record high will be 73 for
today thru Friday.

We're expecting mostly cloudy skies this afternoon with a few spotty showers
developing across the area. Most of this activity should be light. Tonight,
clouds really thicken across the area & more widespread rain and a few rumbles
develop as we move towards early Wednesday morning.

Wednesday morning will start off wet, with periods of rain, but that rain should
taper off during the midday & early afternoon hours. Wednesday is a STORM ALERT
WEATHER DAY, because another round of rain & strong storms will be likely for
Wednesday evening. Damaging winds, lightning, small hail, & even a few tornadoes
will be possible. Stay weather aware for your Wednesday evening.

Rain tapers off by Thursday afternoon, but a warm front lifts north bringing
more rain chances by Friday afternoon.

Our next round of strong to severe storms arrives on Saturday, and this system
could be more potent than the 1st system. Again, severe weather will be
possible. Behind this system, look for blustery conditions with falling temps on
Sunday. If any lingering moisture is leftover Sunday night, a brief wintry mix
may be possible as temps drop below freezing.
