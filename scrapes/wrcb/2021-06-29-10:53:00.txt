Heat and humidity will be the rule Wednesday and Thursday with highs around 90
and the heat index in the mid 90s. Both days may see a few scattered afternoon
storms.

Friday a cold front will bring in widespread rain and thunderstorms during the
morning commute. The models are backing off on the totals a bit now showing
about 1"-2". After 9am we will see only a few scattered showers on and off
through early afternoon. Cooler air will filter in. The high Friday will only
reach 82.

This will set the stage for an incredible weekend. The air will be much drier so
morning lows will be in the low 60s this weekend with highs in the low to mid
80s.
