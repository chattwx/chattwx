Good Wednesday. With temps again near record levels this afternoon, the
atmosphere is now ripe for severe weather, and it looks like we will see plenty
of it tonight.

A line of storms will begin moving through the Cumberland Plateau between 8pm
and 10pm eastern. The line will move through the TN Valley / I-75 corridor
starting between 9pm and 11pm. It will move through the Blue Ridge Mtns from
10pm to 1am.

This is a line of storms that will have good potential to spin up scattered
tornadoes so be very weather wary this evening. Hail, lightning, and heavy rain
are also parameters of this storm. Damaging winds are also likely so downed tree
limbs and power lines are a good possibility.

Have your tornado safe area picked out and ready to go tonight!! Choose the
lowest, most inside part of your sturdy home. Do NOT be in a mobile home
tonight. Find any other sturdy building.

We will clear out Thursday with the high again climbing to 71.

More showers/storms Friday night. Another round of strong storms Saturday night
into early Sunday morning.

Temps falling Sunday with MAYBE some mountain flurries late in the day.
