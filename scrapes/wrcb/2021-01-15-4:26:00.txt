Good Friday! We will have a few drizzles this morning with wet roads to start
the morning. After 9 am any showers will be gone, and the rest of the day will
be partly cloudy and a bit breezy with SW winds at 10-15 mph. Highs will be in
the upper 40s, 50 in Chattanooga.

Colder and cloudy weather moves in tonight. Saturday morning we will be in the
upper 20s and low 30s. We will also have some valley flurries and light snow
showers in the morning. There is a WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY for Grundy, Warren,
and Van Buren counties tonight through 11 pm Saturday. Those areas could get up
to 2" of snow. Other spots on the Plateau and in the Blue Ridge will get 1/4" to
1/2". In the valley, we will have only some flurries and maybe a light dusting.
Saturday afternoon will be cold and cloudy with highs struggling to get past 40
degrees.

Sunday will be cold and cloudy with temps ranging from 31 to 48. Monday will
start cold with some high elevation light snow showers in the morning.
