Spotty showers and storms are beginning to pop up across the area, especially in
our communities west of I-75. These downpours will be short-lived and should not
cause many problems. Showers will fade into the evening as temperatures hold
steady in the 80s. Another round of scattered showers and storms will be
possible late tonight as a disturbance moves in our direction. Lows will range
from 68-72 degrees.

Rain showers will develop throughout the day on Thursday. A few storms could be
strong to severe with gusty winds of 40-50 mph and small hail. An additional
1-2" of rain in some locations could lead to minor flooding concerns. Mostly
cloudy skies will keep temperatures in the mid-80s.

Friday through Sunday will feature a typical summertime pattern with highs
ranging from 86-90 degrees along with plenty of humidity. Scattered showers and
storms will be around each afternoon and evening and fade during the overnight
hours. The overall pattern will favor drier weather next week with highs
returning to the 90s area wide.
