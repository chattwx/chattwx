It will be a splendid afternoon with warm highs 8 to 10° above normal for early
April, into the upper 70s.

Lows tonight will be 8 to 10° above normal too, in the low to mid 50s.

This means, it will be a rather mild morning for the early birds, to look
east/southeast tomorrow morning from 5:30 AM until 7:00 AM. The Waning Crescent
Moon and Jupiter will appear as a duo in the morning sky. For most, it will be
clear - perhaps a few clouds on the Cumberland Plateau, but it looks clear for
most tomorrow morning!

Rain and thunderstorms return Thursday. Rainfall amounts of 0.50" to 1.5" are
possible with the next system, with 0.50" possible in our Tennessee counties,
and up to 1.5" south near Jackson and DeKalb counties in Alabama.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunny, 67

3PM: Sunny, 74

6PM: Sunny, 75
