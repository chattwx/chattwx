Good Morning,

Iota has dissipated over San Salvador, where winds have decreased to 30 mph. No
coastal watches or warnings are in effect. However, the remnants of Iota are
expected to produce an additional 4" to 8" in Honduras, Guatemala, and southern
Belize through Thursday!

It dropped to 34 this morning in Chattanooga, night time lows will get a little
better each night from here on out through this weekend, and next week. Coats
will still be needed Thursday morning and Friday morning as temperatures will be
in the mid 30s and low 40s for the bus stop.

Highs today will stay in the 50s for most-flirting with 60.

It looks like a few fronts arrive next week. This will bring rain chances from
Monday through Wednesday of next week. Preliminary data is showing 0.50" to 1.5"
for this period.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunny and Cool, 51

3PM: Sunny and Cool, 59
