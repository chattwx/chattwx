Good morning, Friday will be cool with a mix of sun and clouds. Highs will be
seasonable around 50. Clouds will increase tonight with lows in the low to
mid-30s.

Saturday will have a few daytime showers, even flurries possible in the highest
elevations to the north, but overall weather will be relatively quiet during the
daytime with highs in the upper 40s. If you need to do work outside, run
errands, or plan an outdoor activity, Saturday is the day to do it. Sunday will
be ideal to stay at home. 

Saturday night more widespread rain will start up around 7-9pm. Overnight it
should generally stay as rain in the valley with some transition to wintry mix
and snow possible in the higher elevations. Murray, Gilmer, Fannin, and Cherokee
Counties will also need to be mindful of some ice possible. As Sunday morning
progresses, we should have rain into wintry mix that will eventually transition
to all snow later in the day as colder air arrives. The transition times and
totals will come into greater focus, but as of now, Winter Storm Watches have
been issued for Marion, Grundy, Sequatchie, Bledsoe, Van Buren, E Polk, and SE
Monroe in TN, Cherokee Co in NC, and Fannin and Gilmer Co in GA. These
communities (especially the higher up you are in elevation) need to be aware of
an impactful winter storm. A Watch means now is the time to prepare.

It will be much colder by Monday morning in the 20s for Martin Luther King Jr.
Day, so please watch out for patchy black ice on untreated roads and elevated
surfaces.
