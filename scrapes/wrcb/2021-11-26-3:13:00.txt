Happy Black Friday! The strong cold front is now to our east which means cold
air from the northwest is diving into the Tennessee Valley. Today will be chilly
compared to yesterday. Morning time temperatures in the 30s to low 40s, but it
won't warm up much more with highs in the mid-40s. Spots on the plateau west of
the Sequatchie Valley, like Grundy County, should have highs only around 38.
Thus, bundle up for Black Friday shopping or Christmas decorating. We'll have a
north breeze at 5-15mph, and clouds will clear up to become mostly sunny.
Tonight will be clear with lows back down in the mid to upper 20s.

Saturday will be mostly sunny with warmer highs in the mid-50s. Sunday will be
partly sunny and in the mid-50s again. Then, a dry reinforcing cold front will
pass, dropping temperatures again for Monday with highs only in the low 50s.
Tuesday will be warmer around 60 with sunshine. Wednesday in the low 60s and
mostly sunny, and Thursday near 65 and sunny. No rain chances for the next 7
days.
