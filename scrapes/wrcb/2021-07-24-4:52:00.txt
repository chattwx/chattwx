The weekend is here! Temperatures will heat up into the low to mid-90s this
afternoon with heat index values approaching 100 degrees. Spotty showers and
storms will be possible in the higher elevations this afternoon. Hazy conditions
will lead to moderate air quality for the rest of the weekend.

Sunday will be sunny, hot, and hazy. A few isolated storms will be around during
the afternoon and evening hours.

Our best chance of rain and storms will be Monday and Tuesday. The rest of the
week will be hot, humid, and mainly dry. Temperatures will soar into the mid-90s
by mid-week as heat index values climb into the triple digits.

In the tropics, we are monitoring an area of low pressure off of the east coast
of Florida. There is a 50% that this area of disturbed weather becomes a
tropical depression in the next two days.
