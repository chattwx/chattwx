The next 3 days will have on and off periods of rain with a few embedded
thunderstorms. We are not expecting any severe weather. The threat over this
time period will be for the potential of flooding, especially on Wednesday. All
of our Georgia and Alabama counties are under a Flash Flood Watch through late
Wednesday night. Rainfall totals will vary locally depending on where the
heaviest downpours set up and if storms train or move over the same areas. On
average 2-3" with a few spots at 4"+.

More specifically for today, it'll be cloudy with highs from 70-74. The window
with the greatest rain coverage should be from 10am to 4pm ET. Wednesday and
Thursday will have highs in the mid-70s. Friday's showers will be decreasing,
mainly affecting areas east of I-75.

Then, the weekend is looking very nice with mostly sunny skies and highs near 80
on both Saturday and Sunday!
