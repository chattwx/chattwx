Good Monday. We are starting the week with a bit more warmth and humidity. This
evening we will be cooling through the 80s into the 70s with a bit of a muggy
edge to the air. Skies will be partly cloudy, clearing late tonight.

Tuesday will be hot and humid with highs in the upper 80s. We will be mostly
sunny to partly cloudy with only a stray shower or storm.

Wednesday through the weekend we will be in a cloudy and cooler pattern with
highs only in the low to mid-80s. We will still be a tinge humid, and we can
expect some scattered showers and storms each day, mainly during the afternoon
and early evening hours.
