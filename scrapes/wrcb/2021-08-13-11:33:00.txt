Scattered storms may affect your lunch break, afternoon, and even Friday night.
For early afternoon, they'll develop along area ridges and then make their way
into valley locations. It'll be hot and humid with highs in the low 90s, heat
index values in the upper 90s. The scattered hit and miss storms will continue
through the evening until about midnight. Thus, Friday night out plans will need
to be monitored, such as Nightfall and the high school football Jamboree at
Finley Stadium in Chattanooga. Evening temperatures in the 80s dropping into the
upper 70s. Overnight lows will be in the upper 60s to low 70s under a partly
cloudy sky.

Saturday will remain hot in the low 90s, and shower and storm chances will
increase, especially during the afternoon hours. Periods of showers and storms
will be likely on Sunday with temperatures dropping into the upper 80s. Then,
daily rain chances will continue through next work-week, and it'll be cooler in
the mid-80s. 

Tropical Depression Fred (currently located north of Cuba) may bring added
rainfall on Tuesday, especially to our eastern communities.
