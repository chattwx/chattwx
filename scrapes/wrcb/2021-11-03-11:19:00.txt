Happy Wednesday, everyone!

We're looking at increasing clouds this afternoon across the area. A weak
disturbance moving in from the west will try to bring some sprinkles, or even a
few light showers through the afternoon hours. This activity should be fairly
light, so no need to cancel any outdoor plans or anything. Temperatures will
likely hold steady or even drop a degree or two as this moisture moves through.
High temps will only top out in the upper 40s to low 50s. Clouds will try to
clear across the Plateau region, but for most it will stay cloudy tonight.

Another disturbance rotates through overnight into early Thursday morning
bringing another chance for a few spotty showers. Thursday begins cloudy with a
few sprinkles or showers, otherwise look for mostly cloudy skies by the
afternoon with dry conditions. High temperatures once again will only be in the
40s to low 50s.

The colder air arrives beginning Thursday night, where many of us will likely
dip down into the 30s. Friday will feature a mix of clouds & sunshine with highs
back into the upper 50s. We will be watching for more areas of frost as we move
into our Saturday & Sunday mornings, otherwise look for plenty of sunshine and
highs back into the 60s.

The sunshine looks to stick around next week with highs back near normal, near
70.

Have a great rest of your Wednesday!
