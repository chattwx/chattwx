Good Wednesday. For all of you "cold-haters", this is your time! This evening
will be a mild one with temps in the 50s. We will drop overnight into the low
40s.

Thursday and Friday will be even warmer as we soar into the low 70s under mostly
sunny skies.

A weak front will drop us back down a little into the mid-60s Saturday and
Sunday.

Another front will bring a few showers late Sunday and more widespread rain
Monday morning. As we clear out Monday afternoon highs will only reach the
mid-50s.

Tuesday will be a cold and dry one with temps ranging from 31 in the morning to
54 in the afternoon.

More rain showers will move in Wednesday morning.
