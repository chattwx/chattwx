A Storm Alert Weather Day has been activated today as we anticipate isolated
strong to severe storms across the Tennessee Valley. The Storm Prediction Center
has placed most of the area under a Marginal (level 1/5) risk for severe
weather. The primary threat will be damaging wind gusts and small hail.
Localized flash flooding will also be possible due to the slow movement of
today's storms. The highest potential for severe storms will be between 1-7 PM.

The severe threat will end tonight, but scattered showers and thunderstorms will
continue. Rain chances will remain high Monday and Tuesday primarily during the
afternoon and evening hours. Highs will range from 82-86 degrees.

Wednesday through Friday will feature a typical summertime pattern with isolated
to scattered storms each afternoon and evening. Daytime highs will be closer to
90 degrees with overnight lows in the 70s.
