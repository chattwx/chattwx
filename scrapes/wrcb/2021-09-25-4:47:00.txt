Happy Saturday! We will wake up to another chilly morning with temperatures
ranging from 46-52 degrees across the region. A few passing clouds will be
around this morning before sunshine takes over by this afternoon. Highs will
range from the mid to upper-70s. Tonight will be clear and comfortable with lows
dipping back into the 50s.

Sunday will be just as nice as highs reach the upper-70s along with plenty of
sunshine. Perfect weather for IRONMAN!

Temperatures will turn slightly warmer next week as highs range from 80-84
degrees each afternoon. Overnight lows will be comfortable, hanging out around
60 degrees. No rain is in the forecast over the next 7 days.

In the tropics, Hurricane Sam is forecast to become a major hurricane later
today. It is too early to determine if Sam will have any impacts on the United
States.
