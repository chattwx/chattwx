Clouds broke earlier today. Temperatures have warmed up. What a beautiful
Saturday afternoon! The urban heat island is on display today with Chattanooga
in the low 70s and everywhere else in the 60s. Regardless, it's a great time to
head outdoors and enjoy. By sunset, it'll be in the low to mid-60s for most
locations. Then, tonight will be cool with lows from 40-46 and a partly cloudy
sky. Sunday will be mostly sunny overall. There will be scattered clouds with
highs in the upper 60s to low 70s and a light north breeze - fantastic spring
day.

Monday will be warmer at 73 and mostly sunny. Tuesday will be the last warm day
of the work-week with a high of 74 and a mix of sun and clouds. Then, a cold
front will approach Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning. A few isolated
showers will develop, but the biggest change will be the temperatures.
Wednesday's official high will likely be at midnight with daytime afternoon
temperatures in the mid-50s. Thursday morning will be cold in the low to mid-30s
with frost possible area-wide. Thursday afternoon will reach the low 60s with a
mix of sun and clouds. Outlying areas will need to watch for frost again Friday
morning, then warming to 68 for the afternoon.
