Scattered light showers/drizzle this Sunday morning will wrap up by around 10am.
Then, the rest of today will be cool with cloudy to mostly cloudy skies. Much of
today will be in the 40s with highs in the upper 40s to 50. Very isolated spots
of additional sprinkles will be possible late afternoon into evening as another
little wave moves through. Overnight, clouds will break slightly with lows in
the mid-30s.

Monday will become sunny with warmer highs in the mid-50s. Tuesday will be sunny
with a high of 55. Wednesday will be in the mid-50s and mostly sunny with more
clouds by evening. 

Rain will start in the early hours of Thursday morning ahead of a cold front and
continue during the day for Christmas Eve. Rainfall will be heavy at times
totaling 1-1.5". As cold air moves in, we could see a transition to flurries and
light snow showers Thursday night into early Christmas morning. At this point,
there's quite a bit of discrepancy on when cold air will arrive. What we do know
is that it'll be much, much colder come Christmas. Friday morning lows will be
from 20-25 and highs only in the mid-30s. What we don't know is the exact timing
of transition to snow and how much moisture will be left, resulting in any
accumulations. We'll continue to update as we get closer to the event.
