Good Tuesday. We are waking up to quite the chill. Temps are in the 20s this
morning. We are even in the 10s on the Cumberland plateau with light snow
showers! As we move through the day skies will clear, but the cold air will
remain with highs struggling to get above freezing. Look for a high of 34. Winds
will blow through the day at about 10 mph. I would expect patchy areas of ice
through the day.

Wednesday will start even colder in the 10s and low 20s. Wednesday afternoon
will warm a bit into the mid 40s. Our next weather system will bring heavy rain
to the area late Wednesday into early Thursday morning. During that time some of
that rain may switch to a wintry mix on the plateau. Through Thursday we will
continue to see rain showers on and off with highs around 45. We will get
1"-1.5" of rain.

Friday will be cold with temps ranging from 29 to 40, and some light snow
showers through the morning.

The weekend will be chilly and dry. Saturday we will go from 22 to 48, and
Sunday 229 to 56.
