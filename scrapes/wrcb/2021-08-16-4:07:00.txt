It'll be a messy Monday morning for many people across the area. Scattered rain
showers will last through about 10am with pockets of the heaviest rain
continuing until about 8am. Combine new rainfall with saturated ground from
areas that received rain yesterday, a few instances of flash flooding may be
possible. Please, use caution driving this morning, especially before sunrise.
Never drive through flooded roads. We'll have a bit of a break from the rain for
around lunchtime through the mid-afternoon. Then, bursts of broken showers and
storms will last from mid-afternoon into tonight. Highs today will be below
normal in the mid-80s.

Tuesday will be a very important day to watch as we'll keep an eye on the path
of Tropical Storm Fred. As of now, the remnants of Fred could bring
Cleveland/Dalton and eastward 2-4" of rain, locally up to 5". Our area will be
right on the edge of the heaviest rainfall with a sharp drop-off in totals
moving westward with Chattanooga around 2". However, the path could still shift
east or west, bringing less or more rain respectively. The primary threat will
be flooding from Tuesday about 8am through evening.
