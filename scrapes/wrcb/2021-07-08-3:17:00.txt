Good Wednesday. We have a few spotty showers and storms moving east this
afternoon. We will see those quieting down by this evening, however. If you are
going to the Lookouts game you will be muggy, but the rain should hold off.

Friday will start dry, but expect afternoon showers and storms with a humid high
of 86. Saturday we will reach 88 with spotty afternoon storms.

A slow-moving front will bring scattered showers and storms to the area Sunday
into Monday at just about any time during the day. Highs will stay in the upper
80s.

Tuesday through Friday will gradually warm from the upper 80s to 90 by the end
of the week. Each day we will have a chance for a few afternoon pop-up storms.

Elsa is still a tropical storm over North Carolina now bringing flooding rain
into Virginia. It will continue up the east coast bringing tropical storm
conditions into Boston and New York by Friday morning.
