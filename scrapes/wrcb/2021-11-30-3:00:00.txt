Good Tuesday. Our warm-up has begun!! This evening we will drop through the 40s
under clear skies. Overnight we will drop into the low to mid-30s with some
patchy areas of frost possible. The afternoon will be almost spring-like with
partly cloudy skies and a high of 67.

Thursday will be even warmer with sunshine all day and temps ranging from 42 in
the morning to a whopping 70 in the afternoon! We will be near 70 again Friday.

This weekend will be fairly cloudy. I don't expect any rain Saturday, but we may
get a few much-needed showers late Sunday into Monday. Temps over the weekend
will remain mild with lows in the mid-40s and highs in the mid-60s.
