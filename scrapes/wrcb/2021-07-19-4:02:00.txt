Scattered to numerous showers and storms will continue today as a stationary
front lingers across our area. The great majority of locations will receive at
least light rainfall at some point on Monday with the heaviest rain and
potential flooding in N Georgia and N Alabama. That's our primary concern for
today - downpours which may cause isolated flooding and difficult travel. On a
positive spin, if you're not a fan of summertime heat, our highs today will be
well below normal in the upper 70s to 80 under a cloudy sky.

Then, activity will dwindle tonight with rain increasing in the early morning
hours of Tuesday through midday. Once again, the heaviest rain will be more
likely for communities in GA and AL. Highs will be in the upper 70s to 80.
Wednesday, we'll get a little break with a 30% chance for scattered
showers/storms, a partly sunny sky, and highs near 84. Thursday will be similar
with highs in the mid-80s. By Friday, it'll be warmer at 88 with additional
scattered showers/storms.
