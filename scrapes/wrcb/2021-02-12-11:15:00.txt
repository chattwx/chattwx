Good Friday! Heading through the afternoon we can't seem to shake these pesky
light showers, and it now looks like they will continue off and on, mainly
Chattanooga south and east, through the evening ending late tonight. We will
remain cool on the low 40s through the afternoon.

Look for rain showers overnight into Saturday morning with temps still in the
low 40s. It will be rainy all day Saturday with temps in the 40s all day.
Rainfall amounts will range from less than 1/4" on the plateau, 1/4"-1/2" in the
valley west of I-75, and 1/2"-1" east of I-75 and in north Georgia.

It now looks like we can reduce the rain chance for Valentine's Day to only a
few sporadic showers during the day with overcast skies and temps ranging from
40 in the morning to 46 in the afternoon.

Monday late afternoon we will have more rain moving through with possibly even a
wintry mix during the evening on the Cumberland Plateau.
