A Dense Fog Advisory is in effect for E Polk Co in TN, Cherokee and Clay
Counties in NC, Fannin and Gilmer Counties in GA until 10am this morning. Fog
may cause hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility, so use caution.
Once the fog mixes out, the rest of the day should have pretty quiet weather. It
will be a mostly sunny Friday with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s. Heat index
values from 95-98. Only a few afternoon to evening spotty storms today. Friday
Night Football games will be in the 80s for temperatures, but it'll still feel
like the 90s especially through the 1st Quarter. Overnight lows will be in the
upper 60s to low 70s.

Saturday and Sunday will be partly cloudy with highs around 90 and generally dry
-- only an isolated PM storm chance. Monday will be partly sunny as clouds
increase especially late in the day ahead of Tropical Storm Ida. (We may get a
really pretty sunset.) Then, Tuesday and Wednesday will have rain from Ida. As
of now, rainfall totals look like 2-3" but these will likely fluctuate as the
track of Ida changes over the next few days. Clouds will partially clear on
Thursday with lower humidity and highs near 84.
