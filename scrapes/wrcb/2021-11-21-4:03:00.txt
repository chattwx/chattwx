Happy Sunday! It is going to be another chilly start, especially along the I-75
corridor with temperatures around freezing. Southerly flow ahead of an
approaching cold front will warm us into the lower-60s by this afternoon. Rain
showers will move in around 6-7 PM and will continue into the overnight hours.
Rainfall totals of up to a half of an inch will be possible.

Rain showers will taper off by 4 AM Monday, and a surge of colder, drier air
will settle into the area. Highs will range from 48-52 degrees Monday before
falling into the 20s during the overnight hours.

Tuesday and Wednesday will feature cold mornings with below-freezing
temperatures and chilly afternoons in the low to mid-50. Skies will generally
remain sunny with a few clouds returning Wednesday afternoon.

Our next chance of rain will arrive on Thanksgiving day as another cold front
approaches the region. It looks like the best time frame for showers will be
during the late afternoon into the early evening hours. A few snow showers will
be possible Thursday night into early Friday morning along the Plateau and the
North Carolina mountains. No accumulation is expected at this time. Another shot
of cold air will settle in for your weekend!
