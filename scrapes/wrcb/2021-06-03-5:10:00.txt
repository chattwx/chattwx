Good Thursday. It is a Storm Alert Weather Day today. We are off to a warm and
humid start with temps in the 60s. Skies are cloudy this morning with spotty
showers popping up on and off. Wet roads will be the biggest threat this
morning.

This afternoon we will have scattered thunderstorms developing. The timing of
the storms will be about 1pm to 6pm. The biggest threats will be heavy rain
(1/2"+), lightning, damaging winds, and small hail.

Friday we will be rain-free with a high of 85. The weekend will be warm and
humid with highs in the upper 80s.

Next week each day will sport highs in the low to mid-80s, high humidity, and
scattered thunderstorms each afternoon.
