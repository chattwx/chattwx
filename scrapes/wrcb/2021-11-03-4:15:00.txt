Good morning, temperatures are a combination of 30s and 40s to start your
Wednesday. Plus, there's a north wind, making the wind chill drop into the 30s,
and our temps won't recover much as the day progresses. Mostly cloudy in the
morning will become cloudy with highs only around 50 today. From about 11am this
morning through noon on Thursday, there will be scattered light
showers/sprinkles. Most locations will only receive a trace of rain from a cool
drizzle with some in GA and NC picking up about 0.1". Thursday afternoon will
have improving conditions with clouds slowly clearing from our northwest. Highs
will be a little warmer in the low 50s.

Tonight's lows will range from 35-45 for most with a Freeze Warning going into
effect for Grundy and Van Buren Counties. The coldest mornings for the entire
area will be Friday and Saturday morning with 30s everywhere. Watch for
additional Frost and Freeze products then.

Friday daytime will have a mix of sun and clouds with highs near 58. Then, the
weekend will be sunny -- around 60 on Saturday and mid-60s on Sunday.
