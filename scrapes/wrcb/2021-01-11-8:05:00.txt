Good Monday. After a wintry mix this morning that brought more than 2" of snow
to the higher elevations, we will continue to see that rain/sleet/snow mix
changing to primarily light rain through the afternoon and into the early
evening. I expect about 1/4" of rain.

Highs will only make it to the low 40s. After 7pm we should see dry air moving
in.

 

Tuesday through Thursday will feature cold mornings in the upper 20s and low
30s. Highs will be a bit milder in the low 50s.

Friday a weak front will move through bringing clouds and a stray sprinkle or
two.

The weekend will be cloudy and cold with lows in the upper 20s and low 30s and
highs in the 40s.
