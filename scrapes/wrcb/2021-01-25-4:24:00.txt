Good Monday. It is a warm, wet start to the day. The rain showers will taper to
just spotty showers on and off this afternoon through the evening with highs
making it into the low to mid 60s!

Tonight we will have a front pushing in some scattered thunderstorms. It looks
as though the biggest threat from these storms will be heavy rain, lightning,
and wind gusts up to 30 mph. Though unlikely, I can't rule out even some
isolated stronger storms producing small hail. Temps overnight will be in the
mid to upper 50s.

Tuesday afternoon will be warm and cloudy with a slight chance for a passing
shower. Highs will be in the mid 60s.

Wednesday temps will range from 46 in the morning to 60 in the afternoon. Low
pressure moving by to our south will bring rain to parts of northeast Georgia
and the Blue Ridge Mountains early in the morning. In the afternoon we will see
skies clearing.

Thursday and Friday will be colder and dry. Thursday temps will range from 34 to
48. Friday we start at 28 and make it to 53.

We will be dry Saturday with a high of 55. Sunday we reach 57 with rain likely.
