Good Monday. Through the evening we will see scattered storms popping up. Some
of them could become severe possibly producing damaging winds and even an
isolated tornado can not be ruled out.

Overnight into Tuesday we will really start to feel the impact of Ida. The
remnants of the storms will bring us persistent rain all day punctuated by
periods of heavy rain and strong storms. Here are some of the possible impacts
of the storm for our area through Tuesday:

RAIN: Flood Watches are already in effect through Tuesday. Widespread we will
get 1.5" to 3.5". However, there are some areas that could get as much as 6" or
7" though that would be the exception. At least localized flooding is likely.

WIND: Winds will blow from 10-20 mph with higher gusts. Accompanying storms we
may see wind gusts in excess of 60 mph.

TORNADOES: We will be on the east side of the low which means small, isolated
tornadoes are very much a possibility through the day.

Wednesday we will see a few remnant showers early then clear out as we move
through the day with a high of 82.

Thursday and Friday will be excellent with highs in the low 80s and low
humidity. The weekend will be nice also, just a little warmer in the upper 80s.
