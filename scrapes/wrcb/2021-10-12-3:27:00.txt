Happy Tuesday! Cloud cover will be on the increase this morning as a cold front
approaches the area. A few spotty light showers will be possible by mid-morning
and last into the evening hours. Rainfall amounts will be light, and some folks
may stay dry throughout the day. High temperatures will range from 77-80
degrees.

Wednesday and Thursday will be dry with skies ranging from mostly sunny to
partly cloudy. Temperatures will be about 5-7 degrees above average as highs top
out in the low to mid-80s.

Friday is when things begin to change across the Tennessee Valley. Temperatures
will still reach the 80s Friday afternoon, but a strong cold front will be
approaching from the west throughout the day. Cloud cover will increase by
Friday evening with scattered showers breaking out during the overnight hours.
Rain chances will continue for the first part of your Saturday, but the big
story will be the arrival of fall-like air! Temperatures will fall into the 60s
by Saturday evening with overnight lows dipping into the 40s by Saturday night.
Sweater weather is almost here!
