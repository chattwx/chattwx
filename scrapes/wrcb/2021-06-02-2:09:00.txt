The atmosphere has moistened up and we have finally seen some showers. Although
as expected they have not been very heavy. We should have a good chance for more
showers Thursday as highs climb into the low 80's along with a few strong
storms. Friday will be warm with highs in the mid-'80s along with partly cloudy
skies.

This weekend will be warm and humid with highs in the upper 80's and only a few
showers late in the day on Sunday. Monday and Tuesday look like they could be
wetter with scattered showers and storms. Highs Monday will be in the low 80's
and expect mid 80's on Tuesday. Next Wednesday may see a few isolated storms
with highs in the mid-'80s.
