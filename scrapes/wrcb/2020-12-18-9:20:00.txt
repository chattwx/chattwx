Good Morning,

It will be a nice afternoon thanks to more blue sky today. Highs will top out
near 50-52, about 10 degrees better than yesterday. Locations in the Smokies
such as Purchase Knob are showing off this morning thanks to a little snow
overnight.

Let's jump into the next rain chance Sunday.

SUNDAY

TIMING: 2-3AM through 1PM-2PM. Rain will be light for the most part ranging from
0.05" to 0.20" during this time.

Another little wave moves in Sunday night-this will be mainly south but over our
Georgia counties and into NC. Rain still looks light during this time: 6PM Sun
night-3AM Monday AM.

WED-THURSDAY

As we look ahead into next week, it is looking promising for another shot of
arctic air to reach us by Wednesday-Thursday of next week. This takes us into
Christmas Eve. While data is subject to change, rain looks to arrive late
Wednesday night next week-transitioning over to a mix on Thursday morning. Model
data is showing much of Christmas Eve DAY dry, as the storm system moves out
around noon or so.

CHRISTMAS

Temperatures will be plummeting on Christmas Eve. This means, as temperatures
drop Christmas Eve night, we may get a light dusting come Christmas Day morning.
Boy, wouldn't that be nice for 2020.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunshine, 42

3PM: Sunshine, 48

6PM: Clear, 43
