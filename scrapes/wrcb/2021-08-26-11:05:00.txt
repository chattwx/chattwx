The heat and humidity will ramp up again this afternoon as high temperatures
approach the lower-90s. Heat index values will once again touch 100 degrees in
some locations. Isolated to scattered showers and storms will develop this
afternoon into the evening hours, bringing a few communities relief from the
August heat. Skies will clear tonight with lows dropping back into the 70s.

Hot, humid conditions will continue this weekend with skies remaining partly
cloudy. There will be enough moisture to produce a few showers and storms each
afternoon. Overall, it is looking like a good weekend to hit the lake or pool.

Tropical Depression Nine will have implications on our forecast for next week.
The latest track strengthens the depression into a hurricane late Saturday
morning. The forecast cone then has the storm making landfall somewhere along
the Louisiana coastline early next week. Deep tropical moisture will likely
increase our rain chances in the Tennessee Valley Tuesday into Wednesday. There
will be changes to the track over the next several days, so continue to check
back for updates.
