Good Thursday. We keep getting warmer. We are starting the day about 10-20
degrees above yesterday morning. We will climb to 76 with mostly cloudy skies
this afternoon. Friday we will hit 78 with clouds and a very slight chance for a
late day passing shower.

Saturday will be a bit cooler in the low 70s, and we may get another stray
sprinkle. Sunday we warm back into the upper 70s with mostly cloudy skies

Sunday will also sport lots of clouds with temps ranging from 51 to 78.

Monday we will have a line of rain showers moving through from the morning
through the afternoon. We will be warm and dry Tuesday, but another round of
heavy rain will move through Wednesday. Rainfall Monday and Wednesday could
total more than 2" next week.

Daylight Saving Time begins 2am Sunday. Spring your clocks forward 1 hour before
bed Saturday night.
