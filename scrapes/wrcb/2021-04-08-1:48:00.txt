Most of the showers that move through the Tennessee Valley tonight will be
ending before midnight. It will be quite mild with lows in the upper 50's and
skies clearing. Friday should be generally dry with less than a 20% chance for a
shower. Highs will be very warm and in the low 80's, with partly cloudy skies.
Clouds will increase Friday night with a few showers developing. Lows will be
mild again and near 60.

Saturday will be wet with occasional showers and thunderstorms. I think some of
the storms will have the potential to be strong to severe. Rain could become
heavy, too. Highs will be in the low 70's. Sunday will see the clouds decreasing
through the afternoon with highs in the low 70's.

Monday through Thursday look generally dry with highs in the upper 70's on
Monday and Tuesday. Highs will be in the low 70's, Wednesday and Thursday. Paul
