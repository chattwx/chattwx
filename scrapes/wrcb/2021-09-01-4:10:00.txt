Today is September 1st which marks the beginning of the meteorological fall
season, and we're going to get a fall weather treat for the next few days. Today
will still have a few scattered showers, but nothing compared to yesterday or
Monday PM. Clouds will be decreasing through the day with highs from 80-84 for
most locations and slightly lower humidity. Wind from the NW at 5-10mph. Then, a
cold front will sweep through this afternoon into evening, fostering an even
greater drop in humidity. Overnight will be mostly clear with lows in the low to
mid-60s.

Thursday will be fantastic! Sunny skies, highs in the upper 70s to low 80s, a
northeast breeze, and relatively low humidity. Overnight lows in the upper 50s
to low 60s. Friday will be mostly sunny with high clouds across the area and
highs in the low to mid-80s. Saturday will be mostly sunny with highs in the
mid-80s. Sunday will have some scattered showers with highs near 83. Then, it'll
be nice again on Monday for Labor Day with highs in the mid-80s and mostly sunny
(only a spotty shower chance).
