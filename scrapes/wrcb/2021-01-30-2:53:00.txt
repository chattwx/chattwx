Saturday evening will have quiet weather with breaks in cloud cover, but by
10pm/9pm CT, clouds and rain will return to our western counties. Widespread
rain will move across the area from about 10pm tonight to 10am Sunday morning.
It'll also be breezy with gusts at 20-30mph. During the early morning hours,
there may be a little sleet mixed in with the rain in the highest elevations.
However, overnight lows will generally be above freezing in the upper 30s to low
40s. The rest of Sunday will have a few scattered light showers with mild highs
around 60 as a narrow window of warm air pushes northward. It will be quickly
followed by colder air rushing back in Sunday night.

Most of Monday will remain in the 30s with highs around 40. We'll be watching
Monday (starting in the morning) to have light snow showers in the higher
elevations and flurries in some valley locations (e.g. McMinn County). Clouds
will break and clear on Tuesday with highs from 40-44. Wednesday will have lots
of sunshine and warmer around 50. Thursday will be mostly cloudy and reach the
mid-50s, followed by rain on Friday and Saturday.
