Highs today are 8-10Â° above normal, topping the upper 70s today. Rain moves in
by 4PM -5PM, and continue through 9PM-10PM. A few thunderstorms will be
possible. There is not a risk for severe weather today, though.

Rainfall amounts of 0.25" to 0.50" are possible through evening.

A cold front will arrive late tonight and early Thursday morning. Highs tomorrow
will be 10 degrees cooler, in the upper 60s with sunshine returning.

Cooler nights are ahead of us, too. Starting Thursday night, lows will drop to
the low 40s. This will continue for over a week. I still don't see a frost in
the next week, but it will flirt with the upper 30s in the higher elevations on
Thursday night, and again Sunday night.
