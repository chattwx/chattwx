Well clouds are holding off for us today, therefore highs will soar this
afternoon to the upper 70s near 76-77Â°.

A strong cold front will arrive on Wednesday morning. This will bring sprinkles
in the morning, and perhaps a few snowflakes for those in the higher elevations
of Bledsoe, Sequatchie, Van Buren, and Grundy.

A northwest wind will be picking up Wednesday, gusting 20-25 mph. Temperatures
on Wednesday afternoon will be in the mid 40s! It will be a cold day tomorrow.
Bundle up and break out the jackets.

A Freeze Watch in valid beginning at Midnight Thursday morning through 9AM for
Bledsoe, Grundy, Van Buren, Sequatchie, Monroe, and Cherokee counties.
Temperatures will fall to freezing in these locations for a few hours resulting
in damaging or killing sensitive vegetation. Plan on covering up plants,
including potted ones on Wednesday night.

We're watching heavy rain increasing by the upcoming weekend on Saturday. Those
south of Chattanooga will get higher amounts ranging from 2" to 3" total.
Chattanooga and those north will get close to 0.50" to 1.5" through Saturday
evening. For those headed to the opening weekend of the Chattanooga Market,
Sunday will be the pick day!
