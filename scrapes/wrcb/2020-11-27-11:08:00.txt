Good Friday! We are heading through a great afternoon with highs in the low to
mid 60s, and partly cloudy skies. Look for some areas of light rain showers
after 8pm lasting until about 3am Saturday morning.

Saturday looks great as we dry out with temps ranging from 46 to 63. More rain
moves in Sunday afternoon through Sunday night into Monday morning. I expect
about an inch of rain from this system.

Temps Monday morning will be in the 40s, but they will drop through the day. As
the colder air moves in we could see some light snow showers Monday evening
through early Tuesday morning. We may get some light accumulations in the
mountains, and flurries in the valleys.

The biggest feature of next week is the cold. Monday the high will only reach
45. Tuesday we will go from 28 in the morning to an afternoon high of 43. It
will stay chilly all next week.
