don't have active rainfall along your commute, please be careful of slick spots
caused by wet leaves. The rest of Monday will have clearing skies becoming
mostly sunny and breezy conditions with wind from the north at 10-15mph, gusts
at 20. The warmest part of today is happening now at 4am. Temperatures will drop
