Good Friday! It will be a wet commute to work this morning. Look for steady rain
showers to last until about noon in Chattanooga. The heaviest rain will then
move east into the Blue Ridge Mtns. After 5pm the rain should be pretty much be
gone from our area. Rainfall amounts will average between .5" and .75".

Tonight skies will be partly cloudy. Temps this evening will be in the 40s, and
we will drop into the low to mid 30s by Saturday morning.

Saturday will be a great day with mostly sunny skies and an afternoon high of
56. Sunday will start cold in the upper 20s and low 30s. We will warm nicely,
however, getting up to 55 in the afternoon.

Next week will be dry although a weak front will move through Sunday night and
Monday morning bringing clouds but no rain. We will start in the upper 30s
Monday morning, but cool it behind the front will only allow us to climb to 47.
Tuesday will be dry and chilly with sunshine and temps ranging from 27 in the
morning to 47 in the afternoon.

We will slowly warm through the week with highs in the upper 50s by Thursday and
Friday.
