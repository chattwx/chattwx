Good Monday. Welcome to March! This is a big warm-up month. The average high
today is 59, and by the 31st the average high has climbed to 69.

We had quite a bit of rain moving through overnight with showers continuing on
and off through the lunch hour. A FLOOD WATCH is in effect from Hamilton, Rhea,
Meigs, and west onto the Plateau where 1"-2" of rain will have fallen. East of
Chattanooga we will end up with .25"-.75". There were also a number of power
outages reported overnight.

We hit our high of 70 just after midnight, and temps will be cooling through the
day. This afternoon we will be hanging out in the low to mid-50s as the rain
moves out and leaves us with cloudy skies.

Tonight will be cloudy and much colder with lows dropping to the mid to upper
30s by Tuesday morning. We will warm a high of 56 with partly cloudy skies. Low
pressure moving by to our south may bring us a few showers late Tuesday night
into the overnight hours, but we will clear out with a high of about 60 on
Wednesday.

Thursday through the weekend will be dry with highs each day in the upper 50s
and low 60s and lows in the mid to upper 30s.
