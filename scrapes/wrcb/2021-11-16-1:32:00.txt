Happy Tuesday, everyone! We're enjoying a mix of clouds and some sunshine this
afternoon. Temperatures are warming up, and we should top out in the 60s for
many areas today. 

Some clouds will help slow the temperature drop again this evening, with temps
hovering in the 50s. We will likely bottom out in the upper 40s to lower 50s by
early Wednesday morning.

Wednesday will feature a very spring-like day around the region. Look for mostly
sunny skies with highs climbing into the lower 70s with a nice southerly breeze.

Our next rain maker arrives on Thursday bringing a chance for scattered showers.
Widespread heavy rainfall is not expected, with only a .10-0.25 on average.

Behind the front Thursday, another shot of colder air moves back into the region
for the weekend. Highs will fall back into the 50s, with morning lows in the low
to mid 30s.

Another front is set to move into the area Monday, again bringing a chance for
showers, followed by another shot of cold air heading into the holiday week.
