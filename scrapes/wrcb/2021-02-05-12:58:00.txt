I am expecting another cold night with lows in the low 30's in the city and '20s
elsewhere. Clouds will thicken up on Saturday with another cool day and highs in
the mid to upper 40's. Saturday night will see a winter mix of snow, sleet, and
rain change over to snow. Lows should be near 34. There could be some
accumulations on grassy areas in the valley, but the best chance for
accumulations will be in the higher elevations. Sunday morning, some light snow
will end and the clouds will break up a bit by afternoon. Highs Sunday will be
in the mid and upper 40's.

Warmer weather is expected on Monday with partly cloudy skies and highs in the
mid to upper 50's. More clouds are expected on Tuesday with highs near 60. The
same will be true for Wednesday. Thursday and Friday will see cloudy skies with
rain developing and highs in the mid 50's Thursday. Paul Barys
