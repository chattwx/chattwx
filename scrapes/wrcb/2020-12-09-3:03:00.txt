Warmer weather will move into the Tennessee Valley for the rest of the week.
Highs on Thursday will be in the mid 60's with upper 60's expected on Friday.
Both days will have mostly sunny skies.

This weekend will see more clouds move in on Saturday. Showers will develop into
the late afternoon and evening with highs in the low 60's. Showers will taper
off Saturday night. Amounts will be near one third of an inch. Sunday should be
cloudy with a cooler high in the mid 50's.

Monday will see a shot of cooler air move in with a light winter mix possible.
Chances will be small. Highs will be much colder and in the upper 40's. Tuesday
and Wednesday will be dry and cool with highs in the low to mid 50's. Paul Barys
