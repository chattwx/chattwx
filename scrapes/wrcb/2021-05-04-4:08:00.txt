It's a Storm Alert Weather Day - there will be a few storms east of I-75 through
the 5AM hour, but for the most part it will be quiet for morning drive time.
Perhaps a few sprinkles.

A line of thunderstorms is tracking east and currently near Memphis... this line
will reach our western counties near Franklin, Grundy, and Marion by ~9AM-11AM,
and increase in Chattanooga by 10AM - Noon. These storms could be strong to
severe.

That's round 1.

Then another round will arrive this evening from 5PM-8PM. An isolated tornado,
damaging wind gusts, and large hail will be possible, particularly west of I-75.

A Flash Flood Watch is up for all our Georgia communities through 2AM Wednesday
morning. Chattanooga looks to get ~1" of rain, while areas south will get closer
to 2" to 3" by tonight.

6AM: Mild, Patchy Fog, 70

12PM: Thunderstorms, 75

3PM: Storms increase west, 80
