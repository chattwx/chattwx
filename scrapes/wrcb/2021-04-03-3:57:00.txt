What a lovely Saturday afternoon to enjoy. The pleasant weather will continue
right into the evening. Sunset is at 8:04pm EDT, and temperatures will be in the
mid-50s. Overnight will be clear and calm. It won't be as cold as the past 2
nights with most locations staying above freezing from 32-38, but patchy frost
will be possible. Frost Advisories have been issued through 9am EDT Sunday
morning.

For Easter sunrise services, expect it to be in the 30s with sunrise at 7:23am
EDT. Sunday will be a fantastic day - sunny skies, light wind, and highs in the
upper 60s to low 70s. A great day for outdoor Easter egg hunts.

Monday will be mostly sunny with highs nearing 75. Tuesday will be partly cloudy
and 75 again. Wednesday will be a tad warmer at 78, partly sunny, and a chance
for a couple of isolated showers. Scattered rain and storms then return on
Thursday and will continue into Friday morning. Friday afternoon looks better
with a mix of sun and clouds. Both days will be around 73 in the afternoon.
