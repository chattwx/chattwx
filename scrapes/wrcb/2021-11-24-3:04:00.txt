Good Wednesday. This evening will be a little milder with temps dropping through
the 40s under partly cloudy skies.

Thanksgiving Day will be a pretty nice one. We will start in the low to mid-30s
and climb to the upper 50s and low 60s in the afternoon! A cold front will bring
in light rain showers for the late afternoon and evening hours. The showers will
be sporadic and at most, you will get 1/10" to 1/4".

Black Friday shopping will be a little cold. Temps will range from 33 to a high
of only 47. Winds may be a bit blustery at times. Skies will be mostly sunny.

The weekend will be dry with highs both Saturday and Sunday in the mid-50s. The
low Saturday will be cold in the mid to upper 20s. Sunday will be a bit warmer
with the low dropping to 37.

The first half of next week looks cool and dry. Highs will be in the 50s, lows
in the 30s, and no rain in sight as we head into December.
