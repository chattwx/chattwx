I am expecting more sunshine for Wednesday and Thursday along with warmer
temperatures. Tonight will be cold with lows dropping into the mid-'20s in the
city and near 20 elsewhere. Highs on Wednesday will be in the low 50's to near
50. Highs on Thursday will be in the mid-'50s. On Friday a few more clouds will
move in with highs again in the mid-'50s.

This weekend will be colder with cloudy skies. Highs will be in the mid to upper
40's. Monday will continue cool with highs in the upper 40's and Tuesday will
see highs near 50 with some clouds. Paul Barys
