Valley fog is developing once again this Thursday morning and will last until
about 9-10am, reducing visibility for your morning commute. Today will be
another gorgeous day although a bit warmer with highs in the mid-70s and a
mostly sunny sky. Clouds will increase late afternoon through the evening, and
tonight will be partly to mostly cloudy with lows not as cold as recent days in
the mid-50s.

Rain chances then return on Thursday. Scattered showers will start up in the
morning around 5am, and will continue on and off through the day - not expecting
any significant rainfall with these. Then, a broken line of rain and storms will
pass with a cold front from about 4-9pm from west to east, producing pockets of
heavy rain and lightning.

Friday will be cooler again with highs in the upper 60s to 70 and partly sunny.
Saturday looks to be nice in the low 70s and mostly sunny. A spotty shower
possible on Sunday with more sun than clouds and warm in the upper 70s.
