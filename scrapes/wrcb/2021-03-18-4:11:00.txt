Good Thursday. The severe weather stayed to the west last night, and heavy rain
turned out to be the story. We were doused with 2" to 5" of rain.

There are a number of flood warnings for local rivers creeks and streams. Many
of them are experiencing minor flooding. Water running across roads may be an
issue this morning.

We will see any remnant rain showers moving out through the morning, and by
lunchtime we will be dry with partly cloudy skies. It will be a little windy
from the SW at 10-20. Temps will be in the low to mid-60s through the day.

Friday will be cloudy, windy, and cooler. Temps will range from 46 in the
morning to 55 in the afternoon.

The weekend will be awesome. Saturday will start at 42 and climb to 62 with
sunny skies. Sunday will start a little cooler in the mid-30s and make it to 62
for the high. Sunday will be sunny also.
