A storm system out west will move into our area on Friday. This will give us
around a half-inch to an inch of rain through Friday night. Clouds will be
slowly increasing tonight. Lows tonight will be near 40 and highs on Friday will
be in the low 50's. Skies should be mostly cloudy Friday evening as the rain
ends in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Lows will be in the upper 30's. Saturday will
see sunshine return with highs near 50. Sunday should be partly cloudy with
highs near 50 again. A few showers may form Sunday night.

There will be a small chance for showers Monday morning with a cooler high in
the mid to upper 40's. Tuesday through Thursday of next week will be dry. Highs
on Tuesday will be near 50, and warmer temperatures will be felt Wednesday and
Thursday as the highs climb into the mid to upper 50's. Paul Barys
