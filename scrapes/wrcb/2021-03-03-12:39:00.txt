This morning was the last rain chance for about a week. A delightful pattern is
setting up, bringing cool nights and pleasant afternoons with very limited
moisture.

Thursday looks fantastic with sunshine and warming a little bit better to near
66-67. Friday will bring more clouds, and perhaps a few sprinkles Friday
overnight. Measurable rain is not expected.

Then the upcoming weekend is trending dry! Sunshine with highs near 59-60 will
make for perfect running and biking weather. The low humidity this weekend will
make it an excellent time for spring cleaning, too.

I wouldn't get too antsy on planting just yet either. Sunday night looks like we
could drop to freezing, near 32-33. Climate wise, the last freeze is around the
end of March.

The next opportunity for measurable rainfall, is over a week from now, perhaps
Thursday-Friday. We'll enjoy this quiet pattern until then.
