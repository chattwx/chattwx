Enjoy the warm, mostly sunny afternoon and evening now because big changes are
on the way for tomorrow. It'll be in the low 70s to upper 60s this evening -
great weather for any kids' games or practices outside.

Then, a strong cold front will pass in the early morning hours of Wednesday.
With it, we'll have isolated light showers/sprinkles from about 4 to 9am EDT.
Any rainfall will be minimal at a trace to a few hundredths. As the temperatures
drop, a few flurries and spitting snow flakes may be seen along the Cumberland
Plateau. Nothing significant. The big story will be the cold and wind.

Official highs on Wednesday for most locations will happen at midnight. Daytime
temperatures will be in the 40s, hitting an afternoon high of about 54. Wind
will be brisk from the northwest at 10-20 mph and gusts at 25-35. Clouds will
clear out for a mostly sunny Wednesday.

Wednesday night into Thursday morning will be unseasonably cold. Lows will be in
the low to mid-30s. A Freeze Watch has been issued for our NW and eastern
counties. Please, plan to protect tender vegetation. Thursday's daytime will be
mostly sunny and mild in the low 60s. Friday mostly cloudy and 67, and then
Saturday will be rainy with a few embedded thunderstorms.
