It's back to wintertime weather after a couple of mild days. Wind chills are in
the 20s this morning with a few spots of flurries. Flurries will last just until
about 7am, but the wind chills will stay in the 20s until about noon. Clouds
this morning will slowly clear for a mostly sunny afternoon. Highs will be in
the low 40s with a brisk breeze from the north at 10-15mph, gusts around 25.

Tonight will be mostly clear with lows in the mid-20s with the north wind
remaining. Friday will be mostly sunny with highs in the mid to upper 40s.
Saturday will have more clouds with a chance for a few afternoon showers as a
system clips our area. Highs around 50. Greater rain will move in Saturday night
into Sunday morning, and then, scattered showers will be possible during the day
on Sunday with highs in the mid-50s. On the backside of the system, a chance for
higher elevation snow showers will start up Sunday night into Monday. Monday
will be colder with highs in the upper 30s to low 40s with a cloudy sky and
afternoon falling temperatures. Clouds will break on Tuesday and in the mid-40s.
Wednesday will be back around 50.
