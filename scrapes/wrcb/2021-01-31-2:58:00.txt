Scattered showers of heavy downpours will continue into the evening hours
associated with a cold front. Once the front passes, much colder air will make
its way into our area tonight. Overnight lows will be around freezing, while
temperatures during the day on Monday will stay in the 30s with a brisk
northwest breeze at 10-20mph, higher gusts. 

We'll also have times of snowfall, starting in the early morning hours and
continuing all the way into Monday night. The likely peak of snow will be from
about 5-11am EST. Snow showers are expected in the higher elevations - moderate
snowfall rates at times. Higher elevations west of the Sequatchie Valley and the
mountains along the TN/NC/GA line will have about 1-2" of snow, a few isolated
spots closer to 2.5". The highest peaks of SE Monroe County 6-9" where a Winter
Storm Warning is in place. Other higher elevations will be on the lower end with
a dusting to 0.5". For most valley locations, mainly flurries and spitting
snowflakes - no accumulations. However, a burst of a dusting to 0.5" on elevated
and grassy surfaces is possible in valley spots north and east of Chattanooga
(e.g. McMinn and Rhea Counties).

Clouds will break and clear on Tuesday with highs in the low 40s. Wednesday will
have lots of sunshine and in the upper 40s. Thursday will be partly sunny to
mostly cloudy and around 54. Friday looks to be rainy with a lot of weather
uncertainty heading into next weekend.
