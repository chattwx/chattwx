Good Monday. The weather theme for the week will be humidity with on and off
showers and storms.

We have a few showers this morning. This afternoon we can expect scattered
storms. They will be hit and miss with the biggest threats being heavy rain and
lightning. The high will reach 81.

Tuesday and Wednesday will sport just a few showers here and there throughout
the day. We will stay warm and muggy with morning lows around 70 and the highs
again in the low 80s.

Thursday and Friday afternoon storms are more likely.

Saturday afternoon storms are likely as well, but we will warm a bit to about
86. The humidity will still be high.

Sunday we drop the rain chance to only spotty showers with a sticky high of 87.
