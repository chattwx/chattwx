Good Wednesday. Other than the high pollen we should start out in a nice way
today with temps in the 40s and 50s this morning, and highs in the mid to upper
70s this afternoon. After about 3pm we will see showers moving through. Spotty
showers will linger through the evening, and taper off late tonight. Rainfall
amounts will range from 1/4" to 1/2".

Thursday will be amazing. We will start with some lingering clouds and a low of
51. Skies will clear through the afternoon with the high only reaching an
awesome 68.

Friday will be mostly cloudy with cool temps ranging from 45 to 68.

We will get a few more showers Saturday morning with temps starting at 49 and
climbing to 66.

Sunday will be overcast with a possible stray shower and a high of 69.

Next week will be dry with highs remaining in the upper 60s and low 70s.
