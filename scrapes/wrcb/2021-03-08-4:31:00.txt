Good Monday. Despite the chilly start to the day we are actually going to have a
really warm and dry week. A big ridge of high pressure will sit over the
southeast this week blocking any weather systems from moving through.

Today we will make it to 69 for the high. Skies will be mostly sunny.

Tuesday we will start chilly again in the 30s, then climb to a high of 70. Temps
will range from 41 to 75 on Wednesday.

Thursday and Friday we will have more clouds moving in and the humidity creeping
up a little. Highs will be in the mid-70s.

This weekend we will change things up a bit. The high pressure will begin to
erode. Saturday will be warm and cloudy with a high of 76. We may see a few
late-day sprinkles. Sunday will be cooler with a high of 68. We will remain
cloudy with another small chance for sprinkles here and there.

Don't forget to "spring" the clocks forward Saturday night as Daylight Saving
Time begins at 2am Sunday.
