Happy Saturday! It's going to be another hot, humid summer day as high
temperatures range from 88-92 degrees. A quiet morning will make way to
scattered showers and storms later this afternoon and evening. There will be the
potential for a few strong storms to develop with gusty winds of 40+ mph and
small hail. Those who remain dry will be dealing with heat index values in the
upper-90s.

A front will stall out across the area Sunday, leading to higher rain chances
across the Tennessee Valley. The severe threat will be low, but a few strong
storms will be possible. High temperatures will top out in the mid to upper-80s.

The forecast for Monday and Tuesday looks to be quite stormy as Tropical
Depression Fred moves inland. The latest track puts Fred to our west late Monday
into Tuesday. Periods of rain and thunderstorms will be likely with the
potential for isolated areas of flash flooding. Rainfall amounts will range from
1-2" with locally higher amounts, especially across the higher elevations.
Temperatures will top out in the low to mid-80s.
