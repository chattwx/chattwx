Bundle up this Thursday morning with most locations starting the day below
freezing. It'll hit around 50 by noon, and then highs from 55-60. We'll
experience a mix of sunshine and clouds today with clouds increasing in the
morning, some clearing in the middle of the afternoon (especially in Tennessee),
and then clouds increasing again for the evening. An overall partly cloudy day.
A few spotty showers will then be possible by about 10pm with scattered showers
developing overnight and lows near 48.

Friday will have on and off showers throughout the day with highs near 65.
Temperatures will remain in the 60s through the overnight and peak Saturday
midday around 68 ahead of a cold front. The cold front also means widespread
rain and storms. We're issuing a STORM ALERT WEATHER DAY for Saturday due to the
potential of severe storms. Damaging wind gusts of 40-60mph will be possible
along with isolated tornadoes. Once the front clears, temperatures will be
dropping. The timing is still fluctuating now, but plan for Saturday morning
through early afternoon. Sunday will then be sunny from the 30s in the morning
to 54 in the afternoon.
