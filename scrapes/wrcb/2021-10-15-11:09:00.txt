T.G.I.F, everyone! The morning fog has mostly dissipated this afternoon, leaving
behind lots of sunshine & warm temperatures. A strong cold front will be
approaching the area today, bringing warm & sunny skies. Highs will climb into
the upper 70s and lower 80s.

A Storm Alert Weather Day has been issued for Friday evening through the
overnight hours.

A few isolated storms possible for our Friday evening plans.

Late tonight, a line of strong to severe storms will be on going across middle
Tennessee. These storms will move into our area after midnight, and should be
weakening, but a few isolated storms could produce some damaging wind gusts
across the western half of the area.

The bigger story once we wake up Saturday morning will be the much cooler
weather that follows. Highs will only be in the 60s this weekend, with overnight
lows down into the 40s.

The sunshine returns by Saturday afternoon, with sunny skies around through most
of next week. High temps will slowly moderate back to the low to mid 70s.
