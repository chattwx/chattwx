Good Tuesday. We will be warm and cloudy this evening with scattered light
showers and maybe even a thunderstorm or two through the overnight into
Wednesday morning. None of these storms will be severe. We could continue to see
isolated showers or storms through the early evening, but they will be very
spotty. The high Wednesday will reach 71.

Wednesday night we will have strong to severe storms moving through starting
around 9pm and lasting into the overnight of Thursday morning. Isolated
tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail are all possibilities with these
storms. Wednesday is a Storm Alert Weather Day.

Thursday we will see the storms moving east and see some clearing with the high
reaching 72.

Friday will be in the low 70s with more rain moving in late in the day.

Saturday and Sunday will ring in the new year with scattered showers and
thunderstorms both days. Storms Saturday night could again be strong. Sunday
will see falling temps so that we may see some remaining moisture combining with
the colder air to produce some wintry mix Sunday evening / night. That is still
a big "if" right now, though. Rain through the weekend will range from 2"-5".

The cold air firmly settles in Monday with temps ranging from 27 in the morning
to 40 in the afternoon.
