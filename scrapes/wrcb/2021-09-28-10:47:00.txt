Skies will remain mostly clear overnight with lows ranging from 55-61 degrees

Wednesday through Friday will feature a mix of sun and clouds each day. Any rain
chance will stay well to our west through the end of the week. High temperatures
will range from 81-86 degrees with overnight lows dipping into the lower-60s.

This upcoming weekend will remain mild with highs in the lower-80s. Cloud cover
