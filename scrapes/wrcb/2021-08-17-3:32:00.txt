Good Tuesday. The heavier rain from the remnants of Fred continues pushing off
to the NE, but flooding will still be a threat through early Wednesday morning.
Much of our area from Hamilton County (Chattanooga) east will remain under a
flood watch until 8 am Wednesday. So far rainfall amounts have ranged 1/4" to
1/2" on the Cumberland Plateau to 1/2" to 1" in the Tennessee Valley to 1.5" to
2.5" east of Chattanooga with those amounts still climbing as of this afternoon.

We will see the showers tapering and most of us will experience just partly
cloudy skies with temps in the 70s this evening.

Wednesday will be hot and humid with a high of 90, and a slight chance for
isolated afternoon showers.

I expect a widespread round of afternoon showers and storms Thursday with the
high being limited to 86.
