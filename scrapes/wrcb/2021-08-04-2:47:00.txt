Happy Wednesday! Conditions will be very similar to what we had yesterday across
much of the area. High temperatures will range from 82-86 degrees under partly
cloudy skies. There will be a better chance of showers and storms this
afternoon, so be on the lookout later today!

Temperatures will climb back into the upper-80s Friday and Thursday with
humidity building back into the region. Skies will range from partly to mostly
cloudy each day, along with a slim chance of a pop-up afternoon downpour.

The heat and humidity return to August standards this weekend as highs return to
the 90s. A few spotty storms will be around each afternoon, but it looks to be a
great weekend to hit the lake and cool off!
