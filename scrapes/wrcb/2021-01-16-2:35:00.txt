This evening will have some breaks in the clouds with cold temperatures in the
30s. A few higher elevation flurries will be possible from about 8pm into Sunday
morning, primarily for Grundy, Sequatchie, Bledsoe, and Van Buren Counties.
Overnight lows will be in the upper 20s to low 30s.

Sunday will have clouds in the morning along with those flurries. Clouds will
partially clear for some from the southwest for the afternoon with highs in the
mid-40s. Then again, Sunday night into Monday morning, there will be another
wave of flurries. These will be for the higher elevations across the entire
area. Both times only a dusting is expected. 

After the light snow ends Monday morning, the rest of the day will be partly
sunny with highs in the mid-40s. Tuesday will be mostly sunny early with highs
in the low 50s. A few isolated showers will move in for Tuesday evening and
overnight. Then, Wednesday will be partly cloudy with highs around 50. Rain
showers return on Thursday with mild temps near 58. Friday looks to be a rainy
day with falling temperatures in the afternoon.
