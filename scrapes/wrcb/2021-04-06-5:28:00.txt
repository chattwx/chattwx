Good Tuesday. The temperature and the pollen are sky high today and tomorrow
with temps soaring into the upper 70s and low 80s.in the afternoon. Tree pollen
will be extremely heavy.

A front will bring in rain and storms overnight Wednesday into early Thursday
morning. The storms will likely produce heavy rain and lightning with gusty
winds. The storms will be falling apart as they move through, and right now the
risk for severe weather is very low, but we do need to be watchful. The high
Thursday will reach 80.

Friday we have a high of 78 with a few showers in the evening. Saturday we will
have another round of heavy rain and some rumbles of thunder Saturday afternoon.
The high Saturday will only reach 71 (which is about where the temperature
should be this time of year).

Rainfall Thursday through Saturday will range from 1.5" to 2.5".

Sunday into Monday will be partly cloudy in the mid-70s.
