After a damp and slow-go this morning, rain will exit the counties east of I-75
by noon, leaving a breezy and dry day ahead with increasing sunshine.

Highs will top near 60 today with winds gusting 15-20 mph.

There were a few really high wind reports this morning about 3AM-4AM in Blount
County, in the city of Happy Valley, where a non thunderstorm wind gusts of 63
mph was measured! In Sevier county, a non thunderstorm wind gusts of 85 mph was
measured!

The wind advisory for those locations have since expired at 10AM this morning.

Ready for some really nice temperatures? Tuesday-Thursday will bring cool
mornings, but lots of sunshine with highs in the mid to upper 60s. The pick day
this week is Wednesday, but all mid week looks great to see what's been coming
up in the garden.

Starting Friday and through this weekend, a wet pattern will make a come back.
This will likely continue into next week. We're keeping an eye on perhaps an
isolated thunderstorm on Sunday.

TODAY:

12PM: Increasing Sun, 55 (wind gusts 15-16)

3PM: M. Sunny and Breezy, 58

6PM: M. Sunny and Breezy, 56
