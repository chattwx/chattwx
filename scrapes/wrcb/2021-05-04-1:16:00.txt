The worst of the first round of storms has exited our area with some rain
showers and general storms left behind. They'll continue moving eastward through
the first part of the afternoon. Due to morning rain, Flash Flood Warnings are
in effect in Hamilton, W Marion, and W Sequatchie Counties, Cherokee County in
NC, and DeKalb County in AL, so please be careful driving and do not drive
through flood waters.

We'll have a bit of a break period for the afternoon into the early evening
before more storms arrive. Storms are currently developing over Louisiana and
Arkansas now. Good News... the worst of them will stay south of our area,
reducing our risk for severe weather for tonight. However, we could still have a
few isolated to scattered severe storms possible generally from 8-11pm.

All TN, NC, and far north GA counties are now under a Level 1 Marginal Risk.
From Chatsworth to Dalton to Fort Payne and south, a Level 2 Slight Risk has
been issued.

All modes of severe weather are possible, but the primary threat is damaging
wind gusts, causing tree damage and power outages. Additional problems with
Flash Flooding will be possible again tonight.

Then, overnight the cold front will pass and we'll experience much quieter
weather for your Wednesday.
