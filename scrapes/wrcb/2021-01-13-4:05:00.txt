Good Wednesday. It is a cold one this morning. Temps are in the 20s starting
out. We also have some scattered fog developing. Many areas are under a
"Freezing Fog" Advisory. Fog is made of tiny water droplets that can become
"super-cooled" (they drop below freezing, but stay liquid form) until they hit a
surface like a road, porch, etc. That freezing fog CAN lead to a few areas of
black ice on surfaces this morning. Use extra caution heading out. We will warm
this afternoon to a seasonably cool 49 with partly cloudy skies. We may even see
a light rain shower or two in parts of north Georgia this afternoon but the
chance is slight.

Thursday will be mostly sunny with temps ranging from 29 to a whopping 54.

Friday we may get a stray early morning shower, but most of the day will be mild
with a low of 40 and a high of 52.

We may get some light snow showers Saturday morning as temps will be in the low
30s. We will clear out late in the day with the high reaching 43.
