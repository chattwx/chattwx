Good Thursday. We will be really entering the hot portion of the forecast Friday
through the weekend. Keep in mind the humidity will not be oppressive so this
will not feel like August or September heat. But let's not kid ourselves. It
will still be hot.

Friday we start out great in the upper 50s, but we quickly climb to the upper
80s with mostly sunny skies.

Saturday we should hit 90 with skies remaining sunny. Sunday we warm to 93 to
tie the record high. We will also tie a record Monday and Tuesday with highs of
94 and 95 respectively.

Wednesday we will have a high of 94 with a few more clouds. By next Thursday we
will have a better chance for a few scattered showers, but still manage a high
of about 91.
