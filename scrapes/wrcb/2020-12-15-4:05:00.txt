Good Tuesday. We are starting out cold in the upper 20s and low 30s this
morning. We will be seasonably cool all day with highs in the upper 40s and low
50s. Clouds will build in this evening leading to a few overnight showers, and
maybe a flurry or two in the mountains.

I do expect rain showers Wednesday morning, and lasting on and off through the
early evening. Rainfall amounts will range from .25" to .5" so I don't expect
flooding, but certainly wet roads through the day. Highs will only make it to
the mid 40s.

Thursday and Friday will be cool and dry. Lows will be in the 20s and low 30s
with highs in the mid top upper 40s.

The weekend will see highs in the low 50s with mostly cloudy skies, and a few
light showers overnight Saturday into early Sunday morning.
