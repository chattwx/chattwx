Areas of patchy fog will reduce visibility in some valley locations through 9
AM. Cloud cover will be thick this morning and gradually break throughout the
day. Scattered showers and a few storms will push through the area, primarily
late this morning into the early afternoon hours. Temperatures will feel much
more comfortable for your Sunday with highs ranging from 83-88 degrees.

Rain chances will dwindle tonight as low temperatures drop into the mid-60s.
Lower humidity will make for a comfortable night.

mostly sunny skies. A few afternoon showers and storms will return to the

looks low through next weekend.
