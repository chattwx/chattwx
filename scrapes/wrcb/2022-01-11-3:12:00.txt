Good Tuesday. We are clear and cold again this evening. Temps will again be
dropping through the 30s. We will keep going down into the 20s Wednesday
morning. Wednesday afternoon will actually be really nice with the high reaching
a pleasant 54.

Thursday a weak front will slide through. It may bring a few afternoon showers
and we may even see a flurry or two in the Blue Ridge Thursday night. Temps
Thursday will range from 33 in the morning to 51 in the afternoon.

Friday we will be mostly cloudy and a bit cooler in the afternoon with a high of
48.

A strong area of low pressure will be diving through the area Saturday and
Sunday. It likes like it will be a rainmaker late Saturday with that rain
changing over to a rain/snow mix overnight into Sunday. Right now it looks like
we will have temps Sunday morning in the upper 20s and low 30s. Some of the
precipitation could be heavy at times, and if we see that changing into snow
(especially in the mountains) we could get some decent snowfall amounts. We are
still waiting before we go all-in on this, however, as models at this point are
still long-range and can be fairly unreliable.

Cold air behind this system will settle back in Sunday through Tuesday with lows
in the 20s and highs in the 40s.
