Good Thursday. This evening will be another nice one with temps in the low 80s
through most of the evening. The humidity should not be too high, so all the
outdoor stuff tonight will be nice.

Friday will be another great day for August. It will especially be pleasant in
the morning and evening hours. Temps will range from 69 to 88. Skies will be
mostly cloudy, but the rain chance is only about 10%.

I do think we will see scattered thunderstorms during the afternoon hour of your
Saturday. We will still make it to the mid to upper 80s.

We crank up the heat Sunday with a high of 91. We will keep going to 93 Monday
through Wednesday of next week. The best chances for rain next week will be late
in the week.

In the tropics, there are a couple of areas we are watching, but one system
coming off the coast of Africa looks like it will probably be our next tropical
storm within the next 5 days.
