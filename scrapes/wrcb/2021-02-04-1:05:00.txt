Rain showers will move into the Tennessee Valley tonight and end before the sun
comes up on Friday. Lows tonight will be in the mid-'30s after the rain leaves.
Clouds will slowly break up for Friday afternoon and the highs will approach 50.
Friday night will see a few highs clouds with lows dropping to near freezing. 

Most of the weather charts are starting to show a return of rain changing
quickly over to a mix and then snow by Saturday night. Most of Saturday will be
dry with highs near 50. The snow will continue overnight for much of the area
but the temperatures will remain above freezing, so the snow will not amount to
much in the valley. But there could be some accumulations in the higher
elevations. By Sunday morning the snow will end with highs in the mid 40's by
afternoon.

Monday should be partly cloudy with highs in the mid-'50s. Tuesday will remain
cloudy with a small chance for a shower. Highs will be warmer and in the upper
50's. Wednesday will be cloudy with highs in the low 50's. A few isolated
showers will develop on Thursday with highs near 50. Paul Barys
