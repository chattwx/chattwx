Good Thursday. Heading into the evening you will certainly need the jackets with
temps in the mid to upper 40s. Skies will be cloudy, and you may get a sprinkle
or two as well.

There is a FREEZE WARNING for Middle Tennessee tonight through Thursday morning,
and that extends into Grundy and Van Buren counties on the Cumberland Plateau.
Most model data suggests temps will be just above freezing in that area, but
areas of frost are certainly a possibility. In the valley areas and in the Blue
Ridge Mtns. temps will be in the low 40s. Skies will remain cloudy and we could
see a sprinkle or two for the Thursday morning commute. Thursday afternoon we
will see some clearing with the high reaching only 53.

Friday will be colder in the morning with temps in the low to mid-30s on the
plateau (a FREEZE WARNING is already issued for Grundy County for Friday morning
also). In the valley we will be around 40 Friday morning. We rebound to 58 with
sunshine in the afternoon.

The weekend will sport cold mornings in the mid to upper 30s both Saturday and
Sunday. Highs will be ramping up: 60 Saturday and 66 Sunday. Plenty of sunshine
all weekend.
