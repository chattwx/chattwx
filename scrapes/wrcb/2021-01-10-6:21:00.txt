The stubborn low level clouds are still covering portions of our area this
Sunday morning. Overall, today will be partly sunny with times/locations of more
sunshine and more clouds. Highs will be warmer than yesterday, but remain below
normal in the mid-40s. Tonight will be mostly cloudy with lows around freezing.

Scattered, light rain showers will arrive on Monday morning. In the higher
elevations, you could have a little wintry mix and light snow, so please be
careful during your morning commute. Scattered showers will continue on and off
during the day with highs in the low 40s. Any moisture will be minimal: rain at
0.25" or less and snow at dusting to 0.5", locally up to 1" in the highest
elevations. Everything should wrap up by about 2am on Tuesday.

Tuesday will have slowly decreasing clouds with highs near 47. Wednesday and
Thursday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 50s and mid-50s,
respectively. Friday will be partly sunny, in the upper 40s, and with an
isolated shower chance to the east.
