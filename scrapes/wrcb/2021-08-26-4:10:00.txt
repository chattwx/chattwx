By comparison to yesterday and Tuesday, today won't be as hot, but it'll still
feel like an August summer day. Morning weather will be mostly sunny in the 70s.
Lunchtime will have a few clouds nearing the mid-80s, and then the afternoon
will be partly sunny with scattered showers and storms, primarily between 3 and
8pm. Storms will start in the eastern mountains and generally move to the west
or southwest. Highs today will be in the upper 80s to low 90s with heat indices
reaching about 96. Tonight will be partly cloudy with lows in the upper 60s to
low 70s.

Friday, Saturday, and Sunday will all have similar weather with highs around 90,
heat indices in the mid-90s, mostly sunny skies, and isolated PM pop-up
showers/storms. Monday will still be hot in the upper 80s to 90 with a partly
sunny sky. Then, Tuesday and Wednesday's weather will be dependent on a possible
tropical system. Right now it's south of Jamaica and hasn't formed yet. We'll be
watching it in the coming days for formation and track as it could bring us
soaking rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
