Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day specifically for the morning commute. It is
not for severe weather, instead we've had a few pockets of moderate to heavy
rainfall in the overnight hours from Chattanooga south to Dalton and Calhoun
north to Cleveland and west to South Pittsburg. At this time, no flooding has
been reported. However, we wanted to give you a heads up before you head out the
door to use caution on low-lying back roads especially before sunrise. 

Mainly light to moderate showers will continue in the general metro area as
described until about 7am ET, after which it'll become more and more broken up.
Scattered hit and miss showers/storms will persist through the afternoon with
isolated heavy downpours. Then, most rain will be done by about 6pm ET. We'll
have cloudy skies through the day with highs in the upper 70s to 81, becoming
mostly cloudy in the evening.

Now onto drier weather! Wednesday through Friday will have a 30% chance for
scattered showers/storms with sunshine breaking through. Highs in the mid-80s on
Wednesday and up to 90 on Friday. The weekend is shaping up to be hot in the low
90s.
