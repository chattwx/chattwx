Happy Sunday! Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms will be around through
the early afternoon hours. The highest rain chances will likely be in our
northern Georgia communities, where up to 1" of additional rainfall will be
possible. Rain chances will diminish early this evening as drier air settles
into the region. Highs will range from 83-87 degrees for your Sunday. We will
also be dealing with areas of patchy fog this morning.

Strong high pressure will result in mostly sunny skies Monday and Tuesday. It
will be quite hot as temperatures top out in the lower-90s. Heat index values
will likely reach 100 degrees during the late afternoon hours.

We will reintroduce rain chances Wednesday through the upcoming weekend as more
moisture moves back into the area. Highs will remain seasonable, ranging from
86-90 degrees each day. Overnight lows will range from 67-72 degrees.
