Good morning, we will be treated with one more quiet weather day for your
Wednesday. It's not as cold this morning, beginning the day above freezing, and
then afternoon highs a little above normal from 50-54. Expect a mix of sun and
clouds today -- at times more clouds, while others getting greater sunshine.
Tonight will slip back down into the low 30s.

Thursday is our active weather day. We're naming it a Storm Alert Weather Day.

What we know: A mix of precipitation across the area with rain, sleet, and snow,
generally from south to north. It'll also get very cold Thursday night.

What is still in question: Where the rain/snow transition line will be located.
Unfortunately, once again our temperatures are on the edge. If the system takes
a south track, more snow. If it jogs farther north, more rain.

What to do: Stay weather aware on Thursday. The timing is fluctuating, but the
current window is 9am-8pm ET from W to E. Locations north of Chattanooga have
the greatest probability of winter weather impacts.

Driving conditions may become hazardous during the middle of the day, but we
also may experience a flash freeze as temperatures drop Thursday night. Friday
morning will be in the teens with wind chills in the single digits to low teens.
