Clouds this morning will break today, with highs topping near 73-74. Overall,
not a bad day to be outside in the garden and walking the pups.

The risk for severe weather has increased again for the Tennessee Valley for
Thursday. There is now an Enhanced Risk for severe weather, which includes
Chattanooga, Dade, Walker, Chattooga, Jackson, DeKalb, Marion, and Franklin
counties.

TWO ROUNDS

-The first round of thunderstorms arrives by 6AM-8AM Thursday morning. Heavy
rain, frequent lightning, and damaging wind gusts will be possible. It's also
possible, that as this warm front lifts tomorrow, isolated cells will develop in
the afternoon. These could spin up, however the greater threat for tornadoes
comes in the evening and overnight.

-The 2nd round will pose the greater risk. By 5PM-7PM, dynamics look more
favorable for tornadoes and damaging wind gusts. Especially to the west. Areas
like west TN, Mississippi, and Alabama have the greater threat, however multiple
tornadoes can't be ruled out west of I-75 during this time through about
Midnight Friday morning.

Once the front clears on Friday, by morning the storm systems will be well east.
Therefore it looks like the risk of severe weather ends around 1AM-3AM Friday
morning.

Please check back with us frequently for new information on this next storm
system.
