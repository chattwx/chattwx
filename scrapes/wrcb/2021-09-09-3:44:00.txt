Good Thursday. What a spectacular day it has been. Well, guess what. Tomorrow we
will have another! Skies will be sunny Friday with the humidity remaining low.
We will start with temps in the upper 50s and climb again to the low 80s.

Saturday will be a great one also. We will again have a cool morning with lots
of sunshine and low humidity all day. However, the afternoon will be a few
degrees warmer with a high of 87. Sunday will be warm and a bit muggy all day
(though still sunny) with the high reaching 89.

Next week will start hot and humid in the low 90s. We will have some chances for
a few showers and storms by the middle of the week.
