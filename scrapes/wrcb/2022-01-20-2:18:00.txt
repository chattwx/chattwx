Good Thursday evening, everyone! Our Thursday has been a cold & blustery day
around the area. Temperatures held pretty steady in the 30s with a biting NW
wind.

Our Friday will feature more clouds across the region, with a slight chance for
a few flurries or a snow shower, especially across eastern areas. Otherwise,
look for another very cold day with highs only in the 30s.

Right now, the weekend is looking dry & quiet with plenty of sunshine and highs
in the 40s & lows in the 20s.

Next week starts off a bit milder, with highs in the lower 50s and sunshine, but
our next weather maker brings us some showers on Tuesday, followed by colder &
drier conditions for most of next week.

Have a great evening!
