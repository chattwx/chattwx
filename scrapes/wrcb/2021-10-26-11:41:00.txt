Morning clouds will slowly but surely clear this afternoon, becoming mostly
sunny. Be patient. It'll take a couple more hours, but the sunshine is out
there. Highs today will be below normal from 60-64 for most locations and only
in the mid-50s for spots on the Cumberland Plateau. Wind from the north around
10 mph.

Clouds will increase slightly tonight with lows from 40-45 in the metro area.
Locations outside of cities, especially to the east -- Cherokee, Polk, McMinn
Counties -- prepare for lows to be in the mid to upper 30s. Patchy frost will be
possible in Cherokee County.

Wednesday will be partly cloudy with highs near 68. Then, Thursday will have
widespread rain with highs around 60. The system will linger over our area
producing additional times of showers on Friday with cool temperatures. Highs
will only be in the mid-50s. Saturday will have scattered showers especially
early in the day with a mostly cloudy sky and highs in the upper 50s. Finally,
by Halloween on Sunday, we'll be dry and sunny with highs in the mid-60s.
