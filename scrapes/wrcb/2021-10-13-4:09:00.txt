Clouds cleared some during the overnight hours, but since then, fog has now
developed. Please, watch for patchy dense fog through about 10am ET. It's
primarily centered around rivers, lakes, and valleys. However, as the morning
progresses it may extend beyond these areas, producing low visibility.

Today will be mostly cloudy with periodic breaks in the clouds - most likely in
the afternoon and evening. Highs will be in the upper 70s, pushing to 80 if
clouds break enough. Wind will be light from the south with a very slim spotty
shower chance. Thursday and Friday will be nicer days with partly cloudy skies
and highs near 84. Then, Friday night into Saturday morning will be cloudy with
rain showers associated with a cold front. The front is set to pass in the
morning with residual rain done by noon. The rest of Saturday will have clearing
skies and falling humidity. Afternoon highs will only be in the mid-60s. Say
hello to fall! Sunday morning will be cool in the low to mid-40s with highs in
the upper 60s and abundant sunshine.
