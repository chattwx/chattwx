The cold front has passed. Precipitation is done, and now, it's all about the
cold air settling into our area. Most of Thursday will be spent in the 30s with
daytime highs topping out around 40. It'll be colder along the Cumberland
Plateau in the low 30s. Add in a blustery north wind at 10-15mph and gusts at
20-25mph, wind chills today will be in the 20s/30s. Thus, a lot chillier today
than yesterday. Tonight will drop into the low to mid-20s with the continuation
of the north wind. The wind will help dry off roads, but be mindful Friday
morning of patches of black ice.

Friday will be mostly cloudy for much of the area with some blue sky for our
northwest communities. It'll be a cold day with highs only in the mid-30s. The
weekend will feature very cold mornings in the upper teens to low 20s with
afternoons in the 40s with mostly sunny skies. Highs won't return to the low 50s
until Monday. Then, a chance for isolated showers returns on Tuesday and cool in
the mid-40s.
