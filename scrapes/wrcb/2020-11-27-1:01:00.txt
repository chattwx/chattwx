We will see a few more clouds move in for tonight. There may be a few showers
form south of the city in north Georgia. Any amounts will be light. Lows tonight
should be in the upper 40's. Skies will be clear on Saturday and the high should
climb into the mid-'60s with a light north wind. More high clouds will move in
for Saturday night with a low in the mid-'40s. Sunday will see an overcast form
with the chance for showers increasing into the afternoon and especially into
the nighttime hours. There may be a few isolated thunderstorms, too. Highs
Sunday should be in the low 60's.

On Monday the storm will pass with showers fading, but cold air will sail in
from the northwest and mix with leftover moisture. This will cause snow showers
in the higher elevations and flurries in the valley. Temperatures will be
falling through the afternoon into the 40's. Tuesday will see clearing skies
with a cold high near 40. Wednesday should be mostly sunny and cool with highs
in the low 50's.

Thursday will see clouds returning with some showers developing overnight. Next
Friday should be wet again with highs in the upper 40's. Paul Barys
