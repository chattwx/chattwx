Wednesday morning will feature overcast skies with a few sprinkles, but clouds
won't last all day. They'll clear from northwest to southeast, becoming partly
sunny by noon. Then, a sunny sky for the afternoon with highs in the mid-50s. A
clear sky this evening means temperatures will drop quickly in the upper 30s to
low 40s by 9pm. Overnight, clouds will increase again with lows around freezing.

Thursday will be partly to mostly cloudy with highs in the upper 50s. Friday
will be mild with highs in the mid-60s. It'll be cloudy with on and off light
showers and sprinkles.

For Saturday morning into early afternoon, we will need to pay attention. A cold
front will bring widespread rain and storms. There's a conditional probability
that we may also see some severe weather. It will depend on if a warm front
lifts up across our area ahead of the trailing cold front. We'll keep an eye on
it, but go ahead and make a mental note. Temperatures will be in the 60s in the
morning, falling in the afternoon. Then, Sunday will be sunny, ranging from low
30s to low 50s. For the latest, download the WRCB Weather app.
