We have a few spotty areas of rain this afternoon. Brief heavy rain is the only
issue. Little to no lightning is expected and any showers will be isolated in
nature, fading away as we head into the nighttime hours. Temps will be warmer
this evening dropping through the mid to low 80s.

Skies will clear out tonight. Thursday will be mostly sunny, but if you want to
enjoy outdoor time get it done in the morning or evening hours. The heat of the
day will sport temps in the low 90s and heat index values in the mid 90s.

I really don't see much change through the weekend as the "Bermuda High"
establishes itself off the east coast preventing any significant vertical
movement of air needed to produce storms. So the basic forecast each day will be
a sun/cloud mix, morning temps in the upper 60s to low 70s, afternoon highs in
the low 90s, and a heat index in the mid to upper 90s.

We will stay hot and humid into next week, but MAY see our rain chances
improving a little bit Monday and Tuesday.
