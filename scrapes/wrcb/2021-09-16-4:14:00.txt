For the next 7 days, we'll have daily rain chances with ample moisture in our
area. Today's early morning showers will primarily affect communities in
Georgia, but coverage of scattered showers will increase northward through
Thursday. It'll be cloudy to mostly cloudy with highs in the upper 70s.

Friday will be mostly cloudy with scattered showers and storms and highs around
80. Unfortunately, rain chances are now trending up for the weekend. Not
complete washouts for Saturday and Sunday as showers and storms will be
scattered, but have a back-up plan for indoor activities especially in the
afternoon. High temperatures will stay below normal around 80.

The active weather pattern will continue into next work-week, too, with
scattered showers/storms Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
