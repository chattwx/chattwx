Good Thursday. It will be another perfect outdoor kind of day today. We are
starting cloudy and warm in the low 50s. This afternoon the sun will come out
and temps will climb into the mid to upper 60s. Tonight we will have rain moving
in overnight into Friday. The rain will be heavy at times, and will last through
the afternoon hours of Friday. That will keep our temps much lower in the mid
50s. I expect about 1" - 1.5" of rain Friday.

We will get a few more light showers late Friday night into Saturday morning.
Temps Saturday morning will be in the low 50s. Saturday will not be a rain out,
but it will be cloudy through the day with sporadic showers here and there.
Temps will range from 53 to 70. We can expect another .5"-1" during that time.

Sunday will be much the same with the high reaching 71. Sunday night into Monday
morning we will have another round of heavy rain. We will clear out through the
day Monday with the high much cooler at 59.
