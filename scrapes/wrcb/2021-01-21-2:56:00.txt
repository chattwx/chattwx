Good Morning,

Light rain will be ongoing for morning drive time. Widely scattered showers will
continue this morning through 11AM-12PM, becoming isolated and hit and miss
mainly across Georgia and Alabama this afternoon.

Rainfall amounts through this period of 0.10" to 0.30" is looking good.

Friday's rain chance is much lower. Most of the shower activity Friday will stay
mainly from I-85 and south. Our southern counties of Chattooga, Floyd, DeKalb,
Pickens, and Gordon counties should plan on light rain tomorrow.

It's the last weekend for Ice on the Landing, too! Saturday is looking splendid,
with sunshine and with seasonable highs in the low 50s. We'll need to watch for
light rain arrives Sunday evening.

NEXT WEEK it's looking a little dicey, especially come Monday. Heavy rain is
looking likely where 1" to 2" is possible. Due to milder temperatures next week,
thunderstorms are looking possible next week, too.

TODAY:

6AM: Light Rain, 42

9AM: Light Rain, 43

12PM: Light Rain, 47
