Good Thursday. We are calling today, Friday, and Saturday Storm Alert Weather
Days as we will have periodic strong storms moving through during that time
frame.

We are starting out with rain showers this morning. These will taper off late
morning into lunch hour. Scattered strong storms will develop this afternoon. A
few of these may produce damaging winds and small hail. The risk is low, but we
still need to be weather aware. Late this afternoon we will clear out with the
high reaching 78. We will be breezy this afternoon with winds from the south at
10-20 mph.

Friday we will be cloudy and dry all day with the high reaching 79. More strong
storms will move in Friday night through Saturday morning. Some of these may
also become strong to severe. Saturday afternoon we will again clear out as the
high reaches a pleasant 71.

Today through Saturday morning we will get 1" to 3" of rain.

Sunday through Tuesday will be amazing with sunshine and highs in the mid to
upper 70s. We will cool late next week. Wednesday through Friday we will drop
into the upper 60s.
