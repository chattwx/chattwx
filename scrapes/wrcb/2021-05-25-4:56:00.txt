Today, Tuesday, will be the third consecutive day in a row reaching 90° or
higher.

Look for sunshine today and a very high UV index of 8.7. Clouds will be
developing in the afternoon, bringing an isolated rain chance after 1PM.

The record high today is 95 from 1953. I'm forecasting 94. It was just 1° shy of
the record high on Monday, too.

Best rain chance this week is going to be Friday. Even then, it's not terribly
impressive. Rainfall amounts of 0.25" to 0.50" looks possible by Friday night.
We'll need to watch for rain during game time for the Lookouts.

Meanwhile if you're headed to the game tonight, it will be warm in the upper 80s
for first pitch, but rain-free!

TODAY:

6AM: M. Clear, 65

12PM: Warming up, 86

3PM: Hot, Sprinkle? 92
