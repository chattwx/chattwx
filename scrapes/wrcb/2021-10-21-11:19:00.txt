Happy Thursday, everyone!

We're looking at mostly cloudy skies after some morning showers. A few breaks in
the cloud cover are possible this afternoon. Our cold front arrives later today
bringing a chance for scattered thunderstorms during the Thursday afternoon and
evening hours. A marginal risk for severe weather is in place across the area.
An isolated severe storm or two can't be completely ruled out, with the main
threats being gusty winds and small hail. A Storm Alert Weather Day has been
issued between 4pm-Midnight.

Behind this front, look for a mix of clouds and sunshine with highs falling back
into the upper 60s to near 70, and overnight lows back into the upper 40s by
Saturday morning. A warm front lifts through the area Sunday morning, bringing
in warmer air for Sunday into next week, along with off and on chances for rain.
Next week looks to be much more active across the region.

Have a great rest of your Thursday!
