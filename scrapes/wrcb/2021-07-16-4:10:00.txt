Friday will begin with areas of river valley fog until about 9am. Lots of
morning sun will warm up temperatures quickly to the mid-80s by lunch with
afternoon highs in the upper 80s to low 90s. It will be a muggy day, so the heat
index will be around 95. Clouds will increase for a partly cloudy afternoon with
hit and miss scattered showers/storms (30%). By 8pm, they will be very few and
far between, so outdoor Friday night plans should not have issues. Overnight
lows will be in the upper 60s to low 70s.

Saturday morning will be partly sunny and generally dry with only a stray shower
chances mainly in our eastern mountains. Then, increased chances for on and off
rain and storms will develop for the afternoon and evening. As of now, key
timing looks to be 2-9pm. A few strong to severe storms with damaging wind gusts
and heavy rain are our concerns. Highs on Saturday in the mid-80s.

Times of showers/storms will continue on Sunday with highs near 84. Monday will
be similar with rain chances then dropping for the middle of next week and heat
returning.
