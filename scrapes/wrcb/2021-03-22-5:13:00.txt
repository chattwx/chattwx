Good Monday. We will continue the nice spring weather heading through our Monday
with highs this afternoon in the low 70s and partly cloudy skies.

Tonight will be mostly cloudy, but it may be clear enough at times to see the
"Winter Circle", a collection of the 7 brightest stars (plus Mars) around the
moon in the southern night sky.

Tuesday looks good with temps ranging from 53 in the morning to 69 in the early
afternoon. During the afternoon we will see showers and some thunderstorms
moving through. While I don't expect severe weather the rain could be heavy at
times. Rainfall amounts through Tuesday night will range from .5" to 1.5" with
the heaviest amounts being south of Chattanooga.

Wednesday will be cloudy with a high of 70. We may see a stray sprinkle or two.

We will have more showers Thursday afternoon into Thursday night. Friday will be
dry with a high of 72.

This weekend will be nice overall with highs in the low 70s. We may get a few
showers here and there both Saturday and Sunday, though the rain chances are
low.
