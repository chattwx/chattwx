Happy Tuesday, everyone! It's a cold & frosty start to our morning around the
Tennessee Valley!

Look for cold sunshine to start the day with increasing clouds this afternoon.
Highs will be quite cool in the upper 40s to near 50.

Tonight, clouds will thicken and we could see a few sprinkles or a few spotty
showers, mainly across southern areas. Overnight lows will be in the upper 30s
to lower 40s.

Wednesday will begin with clouds and a spotty shower. Otherwise, look for
gradual clearing through the day with highs back into the upper 50s. The clouds
quickly return for our Thursday, with highs near 60. Our next storm system
begins to organize to our west.

A warm front arrives Friday bringing scattered showers and warmer air. This will
set the stage for the potential for strong storms Saturday afternoon as a cold
front moves in. Still early to jump into specifics, but we will be watching
Saturdays setup closely. Another shot of colder air is likely by Sunday morning.

Have a great Tuesday!
