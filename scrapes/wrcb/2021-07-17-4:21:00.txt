Scattered showers and storms will continue into the evening hours. Slow storm
movement may lead to areas of localized flooding through 10 PM. Gusty winds and
frequent lightning will also accompany some of the heavier storms. Rain chances
will dwindle into the overnight hours as low temperatures drop back into the
lower 70s.

Sunday will be a similar story with another round of scattered showers and
thunderstorms developing during the afternoon and evening. An abundance of cloud
cover will keep high temperatures in the mid-80s.

The active pattern will continue Monday and Tuesday with storm chances during
the afternoon hours. Drier weather will return by mid-week as temperatures
return to the 90s.
