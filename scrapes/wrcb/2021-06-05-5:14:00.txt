Today will be warm and humid with a partly sunny sky - more sun in the morning
with clouds increasing. Highs this afternoon will be in the mid-80s, approaching
the upper 80s for some locations. The majority of the day will be dry, so enjoy
your outdoor plans. However, we'll have some scattered showers/storms develop
(30%), mainly after 5pm. Overnight will be mostly cloudy with pockets of showers
and lows in the upper 60s.

Sunday will have greater cloud cover throughout the day with cooler highs in the
low 80s. Expect times of scattered showers and thunderstorms. It won't be a
washout, but keep an eye on a few pop-up storms. 

We'll repeat this summertime pattern for most days of the work week. Monday and
Tuesday will be mostly cloudy with times of scattered showers/storms. Wednesday
will have some breaks in the clouds, scattered storms, and a high of 85.
Thursday will become warmer in the mid-80s, 88 in Chattanooga. Friday will be in
the mid-80s. Both days will have additional scattered storms, mainly in the
afternoon and evening.
