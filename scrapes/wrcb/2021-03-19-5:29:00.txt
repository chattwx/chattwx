Good Friday! In the wake of the heavy rain, we still have a number of local
creeks and streams still above flood stage. They are now receding, and all of
them should be back within their banks by tomorrow morning if not before.

We are starting the last day of winter with a last burst of chilly, blustery
weather. We have a few light drizzles this morning with temps in the 40s. We
will stay cloudy and cool through the day with highs only making it to the
mid-50s. We will have a few passing light showers this evening between 7 pm and
10 pm. Skies will clear overnight into Saturday morning.

Spring begins officially at 5:37 am Saturday, and it will be a chilly start in
the upper 30s and low 40s, but Saturday afternoon will be awesome with sunshine
and highs in the mid-60s. Sunday we will rinse and repeat with a low of around
40 and a sunny high of 66.

Monday will be partly cloudy with temps ranging from 42 to 69. The rest of the
week we will slowly warm into the low 70s with rain chances increasing as we
move through the week.
