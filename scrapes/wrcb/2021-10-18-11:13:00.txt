Happy Monday, everyone! We're looking at cobalt blue skies for the rest of our
day, with low humidity and pleasant temperatures. High temps will top out in the
upper 60s to low 70s around the region.

Look for clear skies and calm winds tonight, leading to another chilly period.
Overnight lows will bottom out in the 40s once again for most.

Tuesday & Wednesday will feature a mix of sun and a few clouds. Overall, expect
a nice set of days with highs warming back into the mid 70s and overnight lows
in the 40s to low 50s.

Our next front arrives on Thursday bringing a good chance for scattered showers,
and maybe a few rumbles of thunder. Right now the overall severe weather threat
looks very low. Behind this front, we get a reinforcing shot of low humidity and
sunshine. Highs will be in the low 70s and lows in the 50s.

Have a great rest of your Monday!
