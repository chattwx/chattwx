It has now been over a week since we have had any rain across the Tennessee
Valley. We will continue that dry streak for the rest of your Tuesday as plenty
of sunshine is in the forecast. Temperatures will top out in the 80s before
falling back into the lower-60s during the overnight hours.

Wednesday through Friday will feature a mix of sun and clouds each day. Any rain
chance will stay well to our west through the end of the week. High temperatures
will range from 81-86 degrees with overnight lows dipping into the lower-60s.

This upcoming weekend will remain mild with highs in the lower-80s. Cloud cover
will develop each afternoon with a few showers finally returning to the forecast
late Sunday.
