The Winter Weather Advisory has been canceled for the Cumberland Plateau.

A Winter Weather Advisory remains in effect until 7PM for the Blue Ridge
Mountains for wet snow. A Winter Storm Warning remains in effect for the high
elevations of east Monroe county until 4PM for heavy wet snow and reduced
visibility.

Watch for slick spots on the Cumberland Plateau this afternoon as road
temperatures are hovering near 29-32 for a few hours. These locations picked up
anywhere from 1" to 3" this morning.

While the mix is winding down there, with cold temperatures tonight, we'll need
be mindful of black ice on Saturday morning for this location.

A mix will continue through this evening for east Polk, Fannin, Gilmer,
Cherokee, and east Monroe county.

The weekend will be cold and dry. The next system to watch arrives
Monday-Tuesday. This could bring some winter precip next week, too.

TODAY:

12PM: Light rain/snow mix high elevations, 40

3PM: Mix mainly east near Monroe, Cherokee, 40

6PM: Mix possible east, near Monroe, Cherokee, Fannin, east Polk, and Gilmer
counties, 37
