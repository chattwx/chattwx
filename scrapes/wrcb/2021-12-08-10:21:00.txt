The remaining clouds are pushing out of our far southeastern communities at
11am, and it will be sunshine and blue sky for the rest of your Wednesday. Highs
today in the mid-50s, near 58 in Chattanooga. A clear sky this evening means
temperatures will drop quickly in the upper 30s to low 40s by 9pm. Overnight, a
few clouds will return after midnight with cold lows around freezing.

Thursday will be partly to mostly cloudy with highs in the upper 50s, expecting
to see some sun in the afternoon. Friday will be mild with highs in the mid-60s.
It'll be cloudy with on and off light showers.

For Saturday morning into early afternoon, we will need to pay attention. A cold
front will bring widespread rain and storms. There's a conditional probability
that we may also see some severe weather. It will depend on if a warm front
lifts up across our area ahead of the trailing cold front. We'll keep an eye on
it, but go ahead and make a mental note. Temperatures will be in the 60s in the
morning, falling in the afternoon. Then, Sunday will be sunny, ranging from low
30s to low 50s. For the latest, download the WRCB Weather app.
