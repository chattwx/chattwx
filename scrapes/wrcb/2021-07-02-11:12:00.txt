The awesome weather is here! With humidity levels dropping overnight Saturday
morning should be MUCH cooler and more pleasant. Temps will be in the upper 50s
and low 60s, perfect for a morning stroll or a cup of coffee on the front porch.
The rest of the day will be nice as well with sunshine and highs in the low to
mid 80s.

Sunday looks good as we start out again in the low 60s. We will be a bit warmer,
however, with highs reaching about 90. The humidity should still be fairly low
so it won't be that uncomfortable. Sunday night for the fireworks we will have
great weather with mostly clear skies and temps in the low to mid 80s at 9pm.

Monday the heat and humidity return with the high reaching a whopping 93. We
will stay in the upper 80s and low 90s all week with increasing rain chances as
we progress through the week.

Hurricane Elsa will threaten the state of Florida by Tuesday.
