Happy Wednesday, everyone! The sky conditions has improved quite a bit with lots
of sunshine, and very few clouds. Our Wednesday afternoon will feature more of
our friend, Mr. Sunshineâ€¦but that's not going to help temperatures much. In
fact, highs will likely struggle once again to climb out of the 40s into the
lower 50s around the area.

Thursday is our day of transition. Thursday morning will start off on a cold
note with temperatures in the 20s in many locations, but a warm front brings
southerly winds by the afternoon with highs in the mid-50s.

The big warm up arrives just in time for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day! High
temperatures will soar into the mid to upper 60s Friday, and near 70 on Saturday
across the area. We will likely remain warm through next week.

A front will bring a very slight chance for a few isolated showers Friday night
into early Saturday morning, but overall the forecast looks mainly dry for any
outdoor Christmas festivities!

Have a great rest of your Wednesday!
