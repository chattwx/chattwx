Good Tuesday. We will enjoy another warm one today with varying degrees of cloud
cover and highs in the upper 70s and low 80s. Pollen is extremely heavy again
today. We may get a few passing showers late tonight, but we will then clear
overnight.

Wednesday we will remain dry through the morning hours. Widespread rain will
move through during the early afternoon. Late afternoon into the evening hours
we will have a few spotty showers lingering. Expect 1/2" to 1" of rain through
the day. Late night we will dry out, and set the stage for a much cooler weather
pattern.

Thursday will be sunny and much cooler with temps ranging from 50 in the morning
to 68 in the afternoon.

Friday we will start in the low 40s and climb to a wonderful high of 69.

For the weekend we will have some rain showers Saturday late morning into the
afternoon. The high will reach only 67. Sunday will be mostly cloudy with a high
of 69. The rain chance is only 10%.
