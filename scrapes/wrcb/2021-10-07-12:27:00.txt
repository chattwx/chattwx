Flash Flood Watches are still in effect across all of North Georgia and NE
Alabama until 8 PM this evening. Additional heavy rainfall will be possible
later after 2 PM, especially for our eastern communities. Those to the west of
I-75 will only be dealing with isolated downpours. However, any additional
rainfall in Bledsoe, Grundy, Marion, and Sequatchie Counties could lead to
additional flooding due to high rainfall totals over the last 24 hours.

Scattered showers will gradually taper off tonight into Friday morning. Sunshine
will return Friday afternoon as highs push to around 80 degrees.

This weekend is shaping up to be fantastic weather-wise with sunshine and highs
in the lower-80s.
