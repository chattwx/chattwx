Good Friday! As you head out this evening temps will be dropping into the low
80s with mostly cloudy skies. A stray shower is possible but not likely. You
will notice the humidity creeping higher the later into the evening we go.

Saturday will be warm and humid with a high of 88. We can expect scattered
showers and thunderstorms during the afternoon, tapering off during the evening.

Sunday will just be hot and sticky with the high reaching 91, and the humidity
fairly highs. The rain chance is very slight.

Monday will be partly cloudy with a whopping high of 93.

Tuesday through Friday looks about the same. Mornings in the low 70s, afternoons
highs in the low 90s, lots of humidity, and a few showers or storms possible
each day.
