Good morning, the cold air is well in place now thanks to yesterday's cold
front. We begin Friday in the 30s with a few spots in the 20s, so certainly grab
the coat before you head out the door for work or school. Highs today will be
below normal in the low 50s, but we'll have abundant sunshine with a clear blue
sky. Tonight will be mostly clear with lows around freezing.

Saturday will be partly cloudy with highs from 54-58. Then, Sunday will be
mostly cloudy to cloudy with highs near 60. It'll be dry in the morning with a
stray shower chance in the afternoon. Then, showers will be likely after 4pm
through the night associated with another cold front.

Monday's official high will likely happen at midnight or shortly after as
daytime temps will only be in the 40s with a mostly sunny sky and a blustery
northwest wind. Temperatures in the evening will quickly fall into the 30s, and
then Tuesday morning will begin in the mid-20s. Tuesday will have plentiful
sunshine but remain in the 40s again. We'll warm a bit to 53 on Wednesday, and
then 57 on Thanksgiving. Rain looks to hold off until Friday and Saturday.
