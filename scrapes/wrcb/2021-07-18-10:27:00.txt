Scattered showers and storms will gradually die down tonight with only a few
isolated showers around after midnight. Skies will remain mostly cloudy
overnight with lows ranging from 68-72 degrees.

Another round of showers and storms will develop tomorrow as a cold front stalls
out over the area. Temperatures will be about 10 degrees below average due to
thick cloud cover. Localized flooding will be the primary threat for your
Monday.

It looks like the frontal boundary will hang around the area through much of
next week, sparking showers and storms each afternoon. Rain chances will be
slightly lower by the middle of the week allowing temperatures to return to the
upper 80s.
