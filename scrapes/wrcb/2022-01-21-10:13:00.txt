T.G.I.F, everyone! It's a cloudy & cold Friday around the Tennessee Valley! This
afternoon, a weak disturbance will ripple across the area, possibly sparking a
few passing flurries. This will not be a big deal, but don't be surprised to see
a few flakes in the air. This evening, look for gradual clearing skies and very
cold temperatures. Our evening temps will quickly drop from the 30s into the
20s, and we will bottom out in the teens to low 20s for early Saturday morning!

Our weekend forecast is looking decent. Mostly sunny skies, very cold mornings,
but sunny & milder afternoons. Highs will warm into the 40s.

Next week begins with mild daytime highs in the lower 50s Monday, but our next
weather maker brings us a chance for a cold rain on Tuesday, followed by another
surge of chilly air. This will knock daytime highs back into the 40s with
morning lows back into the 20s for the rest of next week.

Have a great weekend!
