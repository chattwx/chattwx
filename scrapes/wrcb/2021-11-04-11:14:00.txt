Happy Thursday, everyone!

It's been a damp, cloudy, and chilly morning across the Tennessee Valley. We're
expecting the clouds to hang tough today, but the showers should come to an end.
Otherwise, look for cloudy and chilly conditions this afternoon with highs only
in the upper 40s to lower 50s. 

Tonight, clearing skies for the northern half of the area will lead to a frosty
start, early Friday morning. A Frost or Freeze advisory has been issued for all
of Southeast Tennessee, and Northern Alabama. Overnight lows in this area will
range from the low to mid 30s. Clouds may hang around tonight across North
Georgia, so overnight lows may remain in the upper 30s to near 40 tonight.

Friday will feature mostly sunny skies to the north, with partly cloudy skies
across the southern half of the area. High temps will only be in the 50s.

The weekend will likely feature colder temps Saturday morning, with a widespread
area frost, followed by a sunny and pleasant afternoon. Highs should climb into
upper 50s to near 60. Sunday will start off cold again in the 30s, but should
rebound into the low 60s during the afternoon.

Next week will feature sunny and mild temps. Highs will warm back into the upper
60s to near 70, with lows only in the 40s. Our next weather maker may bring us a
chance for stormy weather by next Friday, followed by an even colder blast of
air by next weekend.

Stay warm this afternoon!
