Today will be great for outdoor activities with comfortable temperatures and
pleasant conditions. Highs near the Chattanooga metro will be around 72, warmer
to the southwest in the mid-70s, and cooler in the mid-60s to the northeast.
It'll be mostly cloudy overall with periods of partly sunny sky possible (like
yesterday), mainly for a south and western counties, and there's only a small,
spotty shower chance.

Most of Monday's daylight hours will be quiet with highs in the mid-60s. Rain
shouldn't arrive now until the evening. The system looks to really break apart
across our area, creating scattered showers and a few storms. Nothing severe is
expected. Activity will continue overnight. Tuesday will have additional
scattered showers for areas generally south of Chattanooga and in the eastern
mountains. Highs in the mid-60s. Wednesday will have more widespread rain and
storms. Keep an eye on Wednesday evening/night for the potential of stronger
storms. Rain will wrap up on Thursday morning. Friday will then be a cooler day
with highs in the upper 50s while remaining mostly cloudy.
