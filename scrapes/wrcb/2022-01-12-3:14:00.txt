Good Wednesday. This evening will not be as cold, but you will still need a
sweater heading out as temps drop from the low 40s into the upper 30s. Thursday
we will start out in the low 30s, and rebound to 53. Skies will be mostly cloudy
and we may get a few sprinkles late in the day.

Friday will cool a bit with a high of only 47. Skies will be partly cloudy.

Saturday will be dry for most of the days the high of 48. Low pressure will move
in bringing some heavy rain Saturday night. Overnight through Sunday Colder air
will be spilling in and we may see some of that rain changing over into snow
showers. The path of that low will be a huge determining factor in how much (if
any) snow we get, but expect at least rain Saturday night into Sunday.

Monday will be cold with maybe a few remnant flurries and a high of only 42.
