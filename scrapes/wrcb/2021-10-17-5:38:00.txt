Wow, what a great fall weather treat we have in store for us today. First up,
chilly temperatures to begin your Sunday morning in the low to mid-40s with a
few isolated spots of river valley fog. Sunrise is at 7:49am ET. Once it's up,
expect sunny skies all day long, hitting the upper 50s to 60 at noon and highs

for viewing the stars, Moon, and planets with cool lows again in the low to
mid-40s.

The sunny skies will continue for Monday and Tuesday with temperatures inching
