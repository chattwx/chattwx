Good Thursday evening, everyone! It's been a cold, wintry day around the
Tennessee Valley. A mixed bag of rain, sleet, and some snow has made for a messy
conditions around the region.

Thankfully, the precipitation is winding down across the area, but now we turn
our focus on the quickly falling temperatures this evening, and any leftover
moisture out there that could freeze. Afternoon temps have ranged in the mid to
upper 30s across most areas, but this evening temperatures will drop into the
20s across the entire viewing area, which will likely lead to areas of black
ice. Also, the wind will really ramp up, so as temps drop, so will the wind
chills, in fact feels-like temps will be in the teens later this evening.

Overnight low temps will bottom out in the teens by Friday morning, with wind
chills in the single-digits!

Mostly sunny skies return for our Friday, with temps rebounding into the low to
mid 30s for highs. Saturday will feature more sunshine and warmer temps. Highs
will warm into the upper 40s. 50s return for Sunday, but so will clouds and even
the threat for heavy rainfall. Right now, this system looks to remain all liquid
across the area.

Have a great evening!

Be careful driving overnight and Friday for black ice on bridges, overpasses,
untreated roads, and on elevated surfaces while walking.
