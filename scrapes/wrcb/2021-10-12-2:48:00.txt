Good Tuesday. We will have another nice evening with some clearing. I'll call it
partly cloudy skies with temps this evening falling through the low 70s into the
upper 60s. Do expect more patchy areas of fog Wednesday morning.

Wednesday we may get a stray afternoon shower on the Cumberland Plateau west of
Chattanooga, but any would be few and far between. Overall, Wednesday will be
partly to mostly cloudy with highs in the low 80s.

Thursday and Friday will both be dry with highs around 84.

The weekend we see big changes coming in. We will have a cold front bringing us
some rain showers early Saturday morning. They will be out by 9am then we will
rapidly clear out and cooler weather will begin to move in. I expect a high of
only 68 Saturday. It will be windy with north winds at 10-20 mph.

Sunday will be cool, sunny, and dry. Temps will range from a brisk 48 in the
morning to 69 in the afternoon. We will have a cool, dry start next week as
well.
