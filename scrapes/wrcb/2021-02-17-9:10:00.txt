Travel is highly discouraged beginning tonight through Thursday evening. A
Winter Storm Warning begins at 6PM CST for the entire Cumberland Plateau. This
also includes the higher elevations east of I-75 from Polk, Cherokee, and Monroe
counties, too. Enjoy this morning and afternoon before the next round of winter
weather arrives.

TAKEAWAYS:

A mix of rain/snow/sleet will begin in the Cumberland Plateau near Franklin,
Bledsoe, Sequatchie, and Grundy counties by 7PM-9PM. Winter weather will
increase into the overnight hours. It will start up in Hamilton/Bradley counties
about 8PM-10PM. By 7AM-8AM most of the winter weather will have subsided. It
will be a slick morning commute on Thursday. Due to surface temperatures near
freezing, a glaze of ice will be possible including the counties of Fannin and
Gilmer, where ice accumulation of 0.10" to 0.20" is possible.

ROUND 2:

Will come Thursday from 2PM to 5PM. This next band will have less impact,
however will bring a rain/snow mix causing low visibility and wet roads.

Please check our school closure and delay list as Thursday morning is highly
discouraged for traveling.

TODAY:

12PM: P. Cloudy, 35

3PM: Increasing Clouds, 45

6PM: Watching mix beginning west, 44
