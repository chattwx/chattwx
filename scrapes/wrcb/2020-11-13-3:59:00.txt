Good Friday! It is a much more chilly start to the day with some areas of patchy
fog this morning. We will experience a terrific afternoon with temps around 70,
and clear blue skies.

Saturday will start even cooler in the upper 30s and low 40s. We will again
climb to about 70 with mostly sunny skies.

Sunday another front will move in. That will bring warmer weather and rain
showers to the area Sunday morning. The showers will clear out, and even colder
air will move in Sunday afternoon into Monday. Temps Sunday will range from 57
in the morning to 68 in the afternoon.

Next week will sport even colder weather with lows in the 30s and low 40s and
highs in the upper 50s and low 60s. We will have no rain and lots of sunshine
all week.

In the tropics:
-Eta is now a "Post-Tropical Cyclone". It is off the coast of North Carolina and
moving away from the U.S. to the northeast.
-Tropical Storm "Theta" is still in the east Atlantic and will stay over water.

-The "area of interest" in the Caribbean continues to organize, and will likely
become Tropical Storm "Iota" over the weekend heading for Central America.
