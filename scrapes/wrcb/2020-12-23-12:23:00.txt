Clouds will continue to move in tonight and they will thicken. This will lead to
rain moving in through the overnight. The rain will continue into Thursday
(Christmas Eve). By afternoon the rain will become mixed in with some sleet and
then to snow. The best chances for snow accumulation will be in the higher
elevations. But a dusting will be possible in some valley areas in Tennessee and
extreme North Georgia. Winds will be quite strong tonight and tomorrow. This
will help evaporate much of the rain that falls, so the best chance for icy
patches will be in the higher elevations. Temperatures will be falling
throughout the day on Thursday into the 30's. Thursday night will see lows in
the low 20's and snow showers ending.

Christmas Day (Friday) will be breezy and partly cloudy to mostly sunny with
highs in the low to mid 30's. Saturday morning will see lows near 20 with
sunshine and highs in the mid-'40s. Sunday should be mostly sunny to sunny with
highs in the low 50's and lows in the upper 20's.

A few light showers could develop on Monday with highs near 50. Tuesday and
Wednesday should be dry but cloudy with highs in the low to mid 50's. Paul Barys
