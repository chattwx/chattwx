Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day to get outdoors and enjoy what the
Tennessee Valley has to offer. Temperatures will range from 87-91 degrees this
afternoon with passing clouds throughout the day. A stray shower will be
possible during the evening hours, but most of us will remain dry. Sunday will
feature plenty of heat and humidity as highs once again reach close to 90
degrees. There will be a slightly better chance of an evening pop-up shower,
especially after 4 PM.

A typical summertime pattern will continue early next week as heat and humidity
continue to build into the area. Highs will range from 87-92 degrees through
Wednesday. Showers and thunderstorms will be around each afternoon and evening.

Rain chances will increase Thursday into Friday as a disturbance approaches the
area. A better chance of rain will result in slightly cooler temperatures as we
wrap up the week.
