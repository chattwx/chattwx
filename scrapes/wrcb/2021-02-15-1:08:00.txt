The weather has been horrific west of us into the Great Plains and Mississippi
Valley. So far we have been fortunate. This lucky trend should continue for the
rest of this week. Colder air will finally sneak in from the west tonight, but
the precipitation will slip out of the area before we develop big problems. 

Rain will move in briefly for tonight and should be out of the area by midnight.
The valley areas will see mostly rain with just a small chance for some freezing
rain or drizzle before the precipitation ends. The Cumberland Plateau could see
some slick spots since temperatures will be at or below freezing.

Tuesday will start off cold with lows in the mid to upper 20's in the valley and
colder higher up. There will probably be some slick spots in the higher
elevations. But the sun should break out by afternoon. Afternoon highs will be
in the mid to upper 30's. Winds will be west at 10 to 12 mph. 

Tuesday night will be very cold with lows in the low 20's in the city and in the
teens elsewhere. Wednesday will see clouds increasing with highs in the mid to
upper 40's. A winter mix will be possible Wednesday night changing to rain in
the valley. Thursday will be wet with highs near 50.

Friday through Sunday should be dry with a warming trend back into the 50's by
Sunday. More rain is expected next Monday. Paul Barys
