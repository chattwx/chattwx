Low level clouds will stick with us through the rest of today's daylight hours.
Not until after sunset will clouds break slightly. It'll be a great evening to
cozy up by a fire with temps in the low to mid-30s. By 9-10:00pm, the wind chill
will already have dropped to the upper teens to low 20s. Overnight will be
partly cloudy with chilly lows in the low to mid-20s.

Here's the good news...Sunday will have more sunshine mixed with scattered
clouds. After a very cold morning, afternoon highs will be a little warmer in
the mid-40s.

Monday will have times of scattered rain showers with highs near 44. Also, first
thing in the morning and again in the evening, our higher elevations (especially
to the northwest of Chattanooga) may have a little light snow. Any moisture will
be minimal: rain at 0.25" or less and snow at dusting to 0.5". Activity will
carry into early Tuesday morning. Tuesday will have decreasing clouds with highs
near 48. Wednesday and Thursday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 50s
and mid-50s, respectively. Friday will be partly sunny, in the upper 40s, and
with an isolated shower.
