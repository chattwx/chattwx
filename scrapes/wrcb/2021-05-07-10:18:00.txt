Heading through the overnight temps will again drop into the mid to upper 40s
for a cool start to your Saturday.

Clouds will build through the day Saturday with only a slight chance for an
evening passing sprinkle. Highs will remain in the low 70s.

Mother's Day looks cloudy, but good for the most part. It will certainly be
warmer with temps ranging from 55 in the morning to 80 in the afternoon.

Late Sunday night through Monday morning we will see a front bring in a line of
rain and storms. While the severe risk now looks to be to the west these deserve
watching closely. Be weather aware between 9pm Sunday and 3am Monday morning. We
will clear through the day Monday with a high of 72.

Tuesday looks dry with highs in the mid to upper 60s and lows in the low 50s.
