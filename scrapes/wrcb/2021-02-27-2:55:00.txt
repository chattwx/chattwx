Saturday evening and night will have mostly cloudy to cloudy skies, and just
like during today's daytime, many locations will stay dry. However, areas
generally west of I-75/I-59 will continue to have times of showers as more
activity streams up from the southwest through early Sunday morning. Lows
tonight will be mild in the upper 50s to 60.

The daylight hours of Sunday morning will be quiet, dry, and mostly cloudy to
cloudy. In the afternoon, individual shower/storm cells will start popping up.
These will be hit and miss (40%). Highs will be warm around 75 with southerly
wind at 10-15mph and gusts at 20-30.

The arrival time of the widespread, heavier rain and embedded storms Sunday
night has been pushed back later. The leading edge should hit our northwest
counties around midnight/11pm CT and continue to move eastward during the early
morning hours of Monday. Heavy rain (possible flooding), lightning, and gusty
wind will all happen. A Flood Watch will go in effect at 4pm EST on Sunday until
1pm Monday for Rhea, Bledsoe, and Meigs Counties. Total rainfall expected is
1-2" with the higher end for our north & western counties.

Showers will continue on Monday, fading out as the day progresses, with cooler
temperatures in the 50s. Tuesday will be partly sunny, a high of 58, and some
scattered PM showers.
