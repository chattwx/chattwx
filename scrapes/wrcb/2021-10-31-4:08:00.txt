Happy Halloween! Skies will continue to clear out this evening with temperatures
falling into the 50s as the sunsets. Lows will drop into the mid-40s tonight
under mostly clear skies. Patchy fog will develop after 2 AM which could lead to
reduced visibility for your Monday morning commute.

Monday will warm nicely with highs in the upper-60s before a reinforcing dry
cold front brings cooler temperatures for Tuesday. Cloud cover will be on the
increase late Tuesday into Wednesday ahead of our next approaching weather
maker.

At this time, it looks like our best chance of rain will be Thursday into Friday
morning. There has been a lot of disagreement between forecast models, so the
precipitation forecast is subject to change. Regardless, temperatures will turn
much cooler by the end of the week with our first frost of the season
potentially arriving this weekend.
