We have another hot and humid day ahead, but first, river valley fog is
developing this morning and will last through about 8am. It will be a mostly
sunny morning with a partly cloudy afternoon. Highs will be in the low 90s for
most locations with heat indices in the mid-90s. Topping out around 96-97 for
Chattanooga. A wave of isolated showers/storms will pass from the north from
about 8pm to 2am tonight with lows in the upper 60s to low 70s.

Monday will be hot once more with highs from 90-94 with lots of sunshine,
especially in the afternoon. It'll be humid early, decreasing later in the day.
We won't receive significant humidity relief though until Monday night into
Tuesday morning with a passing cold front. Tuesday will feel refreshing after
our past humid week. Highs will be in the mid-80s with a sunny sky. Wednesday
will be mostly sunny with highs from 80-85, lows in the upper 50s to low 60s.
The nice weather will continue on Thursday with highs in the mid-80s and sunny.
By Friday, it'll be hot again - near 90, mostly sunny, and a spotty shower.
