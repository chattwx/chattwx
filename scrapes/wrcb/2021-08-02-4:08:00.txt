All week long the humidity will be lower than what it was last week, but
especially today, you will feel the difference. It's a nice treat for the
beginning of August. Today will begin mostly sunny in the morning, becoming
partly sunny for the afternoon. Highs will be below normal in the mid-80s with a
northerly breeze. There's a slim chance for a stray shower during the daytime,
but generally it'll be a nice day to enjoy. Then tonight, a few light showers
will sweep across the area, mainly in Georgia and Alabama. Lows will be in the
mid-60s.

Tuesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the mid-80s again. Scattered showers
and storms will develop, primarily east of I-75, as clouds increase for the
afternoon. Wednesday will have additional scattered showers/storms. This time
pretty equal across the entire area. It'll be a partly sunny day in the mid-80s
again. Thursday will be mostly sunny with highs from 84-88 with only an isolated
shower. Friday will have a mix of sun and clouds with highs near 88.
