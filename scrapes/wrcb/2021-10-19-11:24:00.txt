Happy Tuesday, everyone! After some dense morning fog in spots, we're looking at
more cobalt blue skies for the rest of our day, with low humidity and pleasant
temperatures. High temps will top out in the low to mid 70s around the region. 

Look for mostly clear skies and calm winds again tonight, leading to another
chilly period. Overnight lows will bottom out in the 40s once again for most.

Wednesday will feature a mix of sun and a few clouds. Overall, expect a nice day
with highs warming back into the mid 70s and overnight lows in the 50s.

Our next front arrives on Thursday bringing a chance for scattered showers, and
maybe a few rumbles of thunder. Right now the overall severe weather threat
looks very low. Behind this front, look for a mix of clouds and sunshine with
highs in the 70s and lows in the 50s. A slight rain chance will move across the
northern half of the area on Sunday.

Have a great rest of your Tuesday!
