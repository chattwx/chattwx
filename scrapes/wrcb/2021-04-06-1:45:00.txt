Our string of warm days will continue for Wednesday and again on Thursday.
Tonight, we will see a few clouds with a mild low in the mid-'50s. Wednesday
will see a mix of clouds and sun with highs near 80. The chance for rain will be
less than 20%. Wednesday night will see a few more clouds moving in with some
showers developing after midnight and more towards dawn. Lows will be in the
upper â€˜50s. The chance for showers will be increasing on Thursday with highs in
the mid-'70s. There could a stray storm, too.

Friday and Saturday will continue with a chance for showers and a few storms
with highs in the 70's. Sunday and Monday also look warm with highs in the mid
to upper 70's and partly cloudy skies. There is a chance for a few more showers
next Tuesday. Paul Barys
