A few showers have now arrived in our western counties ahead of a cold front.
This broken band of scattered, light showers will move from the west to east for
the rest of Sunday afternoon through evening. Rainfall is light. If you're in
the valley you are more likely to stay dry or only receive a minimal amount less
than 0.1". Higher elevations may receive 0.1-0.2". Once the front passes, clouds
will clear overnight with chilly lows from 35-40.

Monday will become sunny with a north breeze and cooler highs from 55-60.
Tuesday will be mostly sunny with highs around 60. The big travel day on
Wednesday will start with only isolated shower chances in the morning with the
coverage of rain increasing for the afternoon into the evening, making for wet
roads. Highs will be near 62. These will mainly be rain showers, but there may
be an isolated thunderstorm. Weather improves on Thursday for Thanksgiving with
a mostly sunny sky and highs near 67. Friday will have increasing clouds and the
chance for a few PM showers, highs near 65. There is still quite a bit of
discrepancy on specifics, but we'll be watching next weekend for a heavier rain
event.
