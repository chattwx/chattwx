Happy Sunday! The Chattanooga Airport reached 74 degrees earlier this afternoon,
breaking the old record set back in 2015 of 73 degrees. Warm temperatures will
continue this evening with cloud coverage increasing this evening. Low
temperatures will bottom out between 55 and 58 degrees under mostly cloudy
skies.

The final week of 2021 will wrap up with above-average temperatures along with
an active pattern. Monday into Tuesday will feature highs near 70 degrees each
afternoon and a few showers, especially Tuesday evening.

Rain chances will increase Wednesday and Thursday morning as an area of low
pressure develops to our west. Periods of heavy rain will be possible with
rainfall amounts of 1-2". A few thunderstorms will be possible, but the severe
threat will remain low through the middle of the week.

We will be watching another system this weekend that could bring another round
of heavy rain to the area. Much colder air could arrive behind this system as we
usher in 2022.
