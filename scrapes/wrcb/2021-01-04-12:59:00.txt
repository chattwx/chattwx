A few more clouds will roll in for tonight and that will help keep the
temperatures warmer with lows near 40. Tuesday will see some clouds, a northwest
breeze, and highs near 50 which is seasonable. Tuesday night should be colder
with lows near 30 and fair skies. Wednesday will see more high clouds moving in
with highs in the low 50's.

Thursday will see the return of light showers along with some flurries and highs
in the mid to upper 40's. Friday will see a better chance for showers mixed with
snow. Highs should be in the low 40's, but it will be cooler in the higher
elevations for both days.

This weekend will be dry and cool with highs clouds and highs in the upper 40's
Saturday. Skies should be partly cloudy on Sunday with highs in the mid-'40s.

Next Monday could be interesting. Some of the weather charts are showing some
accumulating snow moving in especially in the higher elevations. Stay tuned!
