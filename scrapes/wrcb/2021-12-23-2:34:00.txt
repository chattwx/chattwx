Good Thursday. We made it through the cold this morning. Now we will enjoy some
unseasonably warm weather through Christmas and on into next week.

This evening we will drop through the 40s, so you will still need a jacket.
Friday will start chilly in the mid to upper 30s, and climb to 63 for our
Christmas Eve afternoon.

Christmas day will be a warm and cloudy one. We will start in the mid-50s, and
climb to a toasty 69 for an afternoon high. With the clouds, we MAY get a stray
sprinkle or two, but it won't cancel any outdoor plans.

Sunday will remain warm with partly cloudy skies and a high of 67.

The warmth will last through next week also. We will hit the low 70s Monday
through Wednesday. Then we can expect some showers and slightly cooler air
Wednesday night into Thursday.
