Good Wednesday. It's another jacket-grabber this morning with temps in the 20s
and 30s. We will stay cool through the day with highs struggling to reach 60
under perfectly blue skies. Winds will be light today.

Thursday will start cold in the low to mid 30s, then a bit warmer in the
afternoon with sunny skies and a high of 64. Friday we will make it up to 68 as
southerly winds begin to take over.

The weekend will sport highs around 70 both days with sunshine Saturday and
cloudy skies Sunday.

We will be cloudy and cooler next week. Highs will be in the low 60s. We will
also be cloudy most of next week with sporadic showers on and off each day.
While it's too early to forecast accurately for Thanksgiving, right now the data
is showing low 40s next Thursday morning, low 60s Thursday afternoon, and mostly
cloudy skies with a few showers.

Hurricane Iota is mercifully fading away, and right now there are only a couple
of "areas of interest" in the tropics, but development chances are small.
