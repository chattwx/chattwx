Mostly clear skies will continue into the overnight hours as lows range from
53-59 degrees. A few areas of river fog will be possible after 3 AM but should
not cause much of an issue for your Tuesday morning commute.

Tuesday through Friday will remain dry as high temperatures range from 80-85
degrees each day. A few clouds will be around by the end of the week, but rain
chances stay well to our west.

Temperatures will turn slightly cooler this weekend as highs return to the
low-80s. Skies will range from mostly sunny to partly cloudy with a 20% chance
of a shower Sunday afternoon.
