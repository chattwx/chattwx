It will be a humid next two days. While most will be dry today, isolated showers
are possible this afternoon. A trace to a few hundredths of an inch are possible
today, but that's it.

Highs will be in the upper 70s-10 degrees above normal for November 10th. The
record high today is 80, and it will be close!

An approaching cold front Wednesday will bring rain beginning in the morning. A
few thunderstorms will be possible on Wednesday afternoon and evening. Those
east of I-75 will get the higher rainfall totals where 1" to 2.5" is going to be
possible. While severe weather is not a threat, downpours are possible during
this period.

Humidity drops on Thursday, bringing a comfortable end to the week. It will feel
more like November come Friday, and for high school football.

Preliminary data is indicating a good rain chance on Saturday. All will depend
on what path Tropical Storm Eta takes. Right now, it looks to take aim at
Pensacola and Panama City by Sunday morning-but as a Tropical Depression.
