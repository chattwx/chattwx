Good Tuesday. "June is busting out all over!" The average high on June 1st is
85. That is also the forecast high for today under cloudy skies. By June 30th
the average high climbs to 90. We may get close to that next week.

Wednesday and Thursday we will have sporadic showers on and off. Highs both days
will hover around 80.

Friday will be cloudy with only a passing shower possible. The high will reach
83. I expect the same for Saturday. We will get only one or two showers
Saturday, and we will make it back to 85.

Sunday we will have more widely scattered showers and thunderstorms with a high
of 82.

Next week we will have a chance for scattered showers and storms each day. Temps
will go from the low 80s Monday to the upper 80s by next Wednesday.

June 1sts is also the beginning of hurricane season. There are currently no
tropical systems developing.
