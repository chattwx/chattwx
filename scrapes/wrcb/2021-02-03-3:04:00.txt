The winds will not be whipping up like Tuesday, for the most part look for a
north wind of 5-8 mph today. Perhaps a few gusts to 15 mph in the valley to 20
mph in the higher elevations before noon.

Sunshine continues today with highs in the upper 40s to near 50.

Rain will return Thursday night through Friday morning. Timing is 11PM Thursday
through 7AM Friday morning. Rainfall amounts of 0.50" to 0.75" will be possible
during this time.

Temperatures Friday morning will flirt with 32-33. While I don't see road
temperatures falling to freezing Friday morning, there could be some slick spots
on bridges and overpasses west in the higher elevations. Stay tuned as Friday
gets closer.

This weekend will bring a dry Saturday with highs in the mid 50s. A brief
rain/snow mix is possible on Sunday. At this time, areas south in Georgia and
Alabama look to have the better chance. I don't see this as an event.
