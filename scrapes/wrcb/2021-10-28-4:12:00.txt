We're entering a 3-day active weather pattern as a strong Low pressure system
approaches our area today, lingers tomorrow, and finally moves off to the
northeast on Saturday. Expect on and off rain showers and cooler temperatures
with highs only in the 50s during this time.

Specifically, today is a Storm Alert Weather Day because we will have gusty
non-thunderstorm wind along with periods of rain which may affect travel. (No
severe weather)

When: Today thru 8pm

Where: Entire area - especially higher elevations

What: Breezy conditions... Wind gusts widespread at 20-30mph, isolated gusts at
35-45mph particularly in higher terrain. Additionally, we'll have periods of
rain -- an early morning one, about 9am to 3pm ET, and about 5-9pm ET. 

Impacts: Blown around Halloween decorations, local tree/tree limb damage leading
to spotty power outages possible, slow commute at times with rain

Showers will continue on and off on both Friday and Saturday with temperatures
staying in the 50s. Most rain will finally be done by about 6pm ET on Saturday
evening with only stray showers lasting longer. Then, Halloween on Sunday will
have clouds gradually decreasing for a partly sunny day with highs in the
mid-60s. Monday will be mostly sunny, near 68.
