Temperatures will be a little bit warmer tonight due a high clouds increasing
over the Tennessee Valley. Lows will be in the mid to upper 40's. A few more
clouds will move in Wednesday morning and a few scattered showers will develop
during the afternoon, especially west of the city. Wednesday night will see an
increase in shower activity as lows only drop into the mid 50's. Thanksgiving
Day morning will see showers end very early in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Skies
will partially clear and we will see highs near 70.

Friday will be quite nice with highs near 70 and mostly sunny skies. On
Saturday, skies will be mostly clouds with highs in the low 60's. Sunday will
see cloudy skies with a very good chance for rain in the afternoon and evening
hours.

Monday we will see some light morning showers, but colder air will filter into
the area. This may cause some of the light rain to change to snow flurries in
the higher elevations. This is not for sure, but worth watching. Stay tuned!
