Skies will be clearing tonight as the lows drop into the mid 40's. This is still
a little above normal. Skies should be mostly sunny on Friday after some morning
fog with highs in the upper 60's, which is again above normal. Saturday should
be partly cloudy to mostly sunny with highs in the upper 60's.

Sunday will see clouds increasing and by afternoon a few isolated showers may
develop. Any amounts will be light. Highs should be in the low 70's to near 70.

Dry weather will continue for next week with highs much cooler and in the upper
50's to near 60. Sunshine should be abundant. Paul Barys
