The few remaining spotty light showers/sprinkles will end by noon in our
northern tier today with a warm, dry afternoon to follow. It'll be partly sunny
with highs in the low 80s - about 83 in Chattanooga. It'll be breezy at times
with wind from the southeast at 5-15mph, gusts at 20. Good kite flying weather
for the kids after school. Then, tonight will be partly cloudy with lows in the
low 60s.

Thursday will have some clouds in the morning, becoming mostly sunny with highs
around 85. By Friday, the upper ridge we've been mentioning will really start to
build up, bringing us those hotter temperatures. Friday will be near 88 with
abundant sunshine and only a few clouds. Saturday will be in the upper 80s to 90
with scattered clouds. If we don't hit 90 on Saturday, we will on Sunday with a
high of 92. The heat continues on Monday with a high of 93.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the ridge will start to break and we'll return to a
more zonal wind flow pattern aloft. However, even with this change, the heat
remains. Highs near 94 on both days, but the difference is that we may see a
spotty light shower.
