Happy Sunday! We are waking up to another chilly morning with temperatures
ranging from 30-36 degrees. It will warm up quickly this afternoon as highs
approach 60 degrees. Cloud cover will be on the increase this afternoon as a dry
cold front approaches from the west. Reinforcing cooler air will settle across
the area behind the front, making for another cold night with overnight lows
below freezing.

Monday will feature sunny skies and chilly temperatures. Highs will range from
48-53 degrees with overnight lows around freezing.

A warming trend will begin Tuesday as highs return to the 60s. Above-average
temperatures will continue Wednesday through Saturday as highs reach the mid to
upper-60s each afternoon. No rain in the forecast through this weekend. It looks
like it is going to a mild, dry start to December!
