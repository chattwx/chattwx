Good Wednesday. Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day. We will climb to the mid 60s
this afternoon with some on and off showers. An approaching front will spawn
scattered strong storms this evening from 6pm to about midnight. The biggest
threats will be:

-Heavy Rain. Most will get 1/4"-1/2", but up to 1" is possible in isolated
spots.

-Damaging Winds. Wind gusts of 60+mph are possible with evening storms

-Isolated Tornadoes. While the risk is small, it is present. The Storm
Prediction Center puts Chattanooga in a 2% risk for tornadoes primarily this
evening.

Thanksgiving looks great as we start the day in the low 50s and climb to the
upper 60s under partly cloudy skies. Friday will be just as nice. It will be a
little cooler in the morning at 42, but warm to the mid-60s.

Saturday looks good. We will start in the mid-40s, and climb to the low 60s
under mostly sunny skies, Sunday we may see a few spotty showers late in the
day. Next week will be MUCH colder with highs in the 40s and lows in the 20s.
Possibly flurries Tuesday morning.
