A Flash Flood Watch is valid Wednesday for the Tennessee Valley as heavy rain
and thunderstorms return.

Enjoy today, even with the annual pollen explosion ongoing! Pollen counts
yesterday were in the 3,000s. Today, it's in the 2,000s. Tomorrow's rain will
help.

A few isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from 8AM through 1PM
on Wednesday. While rain will be ongoing through Wednesday evening, isolated
localized flooding, along with flooding from creeks and streams will be
possible. Rainfall amounts of 1" to 3" are likely with Chattanooga, in the 2" to
3" range.

Currently- March 2021 stands as the 7th wettest March on record. With tomorrow's
rain - it's likely it will end in the top 5 wettest on record.

A Dogwood Winter will come by Thursday and Friday nights. Lows will drop to
freezing. Potted plants will need to be brought in those nights, and sensitive
outdoor vegetation in the ground will need to be covered. This includes little
seedlings coming up in vegetable gardens.

Easter weekend is looking quiet, thankfully. A nice dry pattern appears to be
setting up next week, too.
