Happy Hump Day, everyone! We're looking at another gorgeous day around the
region with lots of sunshine and very warm temperatures. Highs will likely climb
into the low to mid 70s. Clouds will be on the increase this evening and
especially overnight, leading to much warmer conditions. Overnight lows will
only fall into the upper 40s and lower 50s.

Thursday begins with clouds & maybe a few sprinkles. Widespread rain chances
arrive from west to east across the area for our Thursday afternoon. Right now,
looks like a band of rain with a few embedded rumbles of thunder will move
through between about 1pm-9pm. We're not expecting any widespread severe
weather, but a few isolated rumbles with downpours and a flash of lightning will
be possible.

The rain clears out of the area for Friday, with clearing skies & blustery
conditions. Highs will only be near 60. Sunshine returns for the weekend, but
high temps will be much colder, only in the low to mid 50s and overnight lows
will be down into the low to mid 30s.

A few dry fronts arrive to reinforce the colder airmass Saturday and then again
on Monday. We will likely be looking at several mornings in the 20s and 30s
starting this weekend into next week. Brrr!

Enjoy the rest of our warm Wednesday!
