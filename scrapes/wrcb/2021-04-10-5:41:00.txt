Welcome to the weekend! First, if you can make a choice of which day to do an
outdoor activity, Sunday will be a better option than Saturday.

Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day. There is a low-end Level 1 Marginal risk for
isolated severe storms today for everyone. The primary threat will be damaging
wind gusts, but a brief tornado cannot be ruled out. The risk for hail is low
and will be in isolated cases. If it does happen, it will likely be small hail
from pea to penny size - below severe criteria. Rain and storms will last from
about 8am to 5pm EDT from west to east. It'll come in 2 general bursts. The
first from 8am-1pm, and then a second one lifting up from the south from about
1pm-5pm, which will primarily affect areas from Chattanooga and east. Confidence
in the second burst is lower, but something to keep an eye on if you had plans
to be outside this afternoon. Total rainfall at 0.5-1" on average. Higher totals
will be possible where stronger storms develop at about 1.5".

The early evening will be quiet. Then, a cold front will pass us tonight,
bringing a narrow line of scattered showers/storms from about 8pm to 2am from
west to east. Today will be breezy with south wind at 10-20mph, gusts at
20-30mph, stronger in the higher elevations. Highs will be in the upper 60s to
70.

Sunday will be the much nicer day of the weekend. Expect sunny skies with only a
few clouds, and highs in the low 70s. Wind will be from the west at 5-15mph.
Monday will be sunny and warmer in the upper 70s. Tuesday will be partly sunny
with highs near 73.
