The splendid spring weather is a great end to the weekend. Sunny skies and
breezy conditions will continue this evening with temperatures in the low 70s to
upper 60s. Sunset is at 8:10pm EDT. We'll have a clear sky tonight with wind
decreasing to about 5mph and lows in the upper 40s to low 50s.

Monday will be sunny and warmer around 80 with westerly wind at 8-15mph. Some
clouds will move in Monday evening, and then, Tuesday will be a partly sunny day
with a small chance for a spotty sprinkle in the afternoon. Wednesday will be
mostly cloudy with scattered PM rain showers. It'll be a cooler day with highs
near 68. Thursday will be mostly sunny and mild - 40s in the morning, 60s in the
afternoon. The work week will end with a mix of sun and clouds on Friday and
highs in the upper 60s to 70. All week long, the pollen count should remain very
high. It doesn't look like we'll receive enough rain on Wednesday to force a
significant drop.

Both Saturday and Sunday of next weekend will have a few showers and highs in
the upper 60s.
