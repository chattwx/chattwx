Good Monday. Some well-deserved nice weather is in store to start the week. We
will have a cool crisp evening to enjoy with clear skies and temps in the 40s,
dropping to the 30s by late tonight. Overnight we will see lows dropping into
the upper 20s and low 30s around the area.

Tuesday afternoon looks great with mostly sunny skies and a high of 60. We will
warm a little Wednesday with temps from 42 to 64.

Thursday we see clouds rolling in with temps climbing to the upper 60s. We will
see mostly cloudy skies and a slight chance for a stray shower as a front stalls
to our west. We will have that front stalling through Friday meaning more clouds
and a sprinkle or two Friday with our temps ramping up even more to a high of
71.

The front will break through Saturday bringing widespread showers with a few
possible rumbles of thunder. The high will reach 67

We may see a few remnant showers Sunday also with cooler weather filtering in.
The high will only reach 56.
