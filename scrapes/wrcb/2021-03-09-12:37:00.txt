Warm weather will continue for the rest of this week and into the weekend. The
normal highs are in the low 60's and we should be well above those temperatures.
Skies should be partly cloudy on Wednesday with highs in the mid-'70s. Thursday
will be a bit more breezy with a south wind and highs again in the mid-'70s. A
few more clouds will move in Friday with highs in the mid-'70s.

 

This weekend will have mostly cloudy to cloudy skies and highs near 70. There
may be a sprinkle or two Saturday. The chances for rain will be increasing
rapidly on Monday with highs in the mid-'60s. Tuesday should be cloudy with
highs in the upper 60's. Paul Barys
