Good Wednesday. It is a cloudy and comfortable afternoon... as long as you are
getting one of the heavy downpours that have been moving through parts of the
Tennessee Valley. Temps have been in the 70s all day. This evening we will see
any showers tapering off. Expect mostly cloudy skies with temps falling into the
low 70s.

Thursday will remain mostly cloudy and cool with a high of 79. We may get a few
spotty showers on and off through the day.

Friday will be the same, though a few degrees warmer with a high of 82.

I don't expect much change over the weekend. Highs will be in the low 80s both
days with cloudy skies and a few showers possible both days, primarily during
the afternoon.
