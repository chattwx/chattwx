Good Thursday. Go slow during the commute this morning. While our friends in
west Tennessee are dealing with an ice storm we will have rainy weather with the
rain heavy at times through the day. Hydroplaning and ponding will be possible
on the roads. Temps through the day will be in the upper 40s and low 50s. The
rain will taper to scattered showers this afternoon and then end completely
after 7pm. Rainfall today will range from .5" to1".

Friday will be cloudy, cool, and dry. Temps will range from 41 in the morning to
51 in the afternoon.

More rain moves in through the day Saturday. It will be in the 40s all day.

Valentine's Day we could see a few showers in the morning, but rain is more
likely in the afternoon and evening. Rain this weekend will range from 1"-2"

Monday we may get a light wintry mix in the morning with heavier rain MAYBE
changing to a wintry mix during the evening.
