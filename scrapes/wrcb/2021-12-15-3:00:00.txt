Good Wednesday. We are in for a mild evening with temps in the low to mid-50s.

Thursday will start much warmer than previous mornings with lows in the mid to
upper 40s climbing to the upper 60s by the afternoon. Skies will be mostly
cloudy. A front stalled to our west may shoot a stray shower or two over the
plateau around midnight, but I don't expect anything major.

Friday will remain warm and cloudy with the high reaching 70. The record high is
73. We will get close.

Saturday the front breaks through with showers on and off through the day. At
the end of the day, we could see 1/4" to 1/2" with locally higher amounts.

Sunday cold air moves in behind the front. Temps will range from 38 for the low
to only 50 for the high, and lots of folks won't get out of the 40s.

Monday stays chilly under a partly cloudy sky and temps from 32 to 55.
