Happy Tuesday, everyone! Our friend Mr. Sunshine returned today, helping to warm
us up into the upper 40s, and make it look and feel a lot better! This evening,
we will begin with clear skies, but look for some clouds to arrive from the
south tonight. The clouds will help hold our temperatures up into the 30s for
most areas.

Wednesday will feature a mix of clouds and sunshine, but a southwest wind will
help warm our temps up into the lower 50s for the afternoon hours.

Our next weather maker arrives on Thursday, bringing another wintry weather
threat to the area. The latest data continues to trend farther south with our
low pressure which means colder temperatures, and the better chance for a wintry
mix to snow for the area.

Still too early for specifics, but plan on some messy weather Thursday and
Thursday evening around the Tennessee Valley. Behind the wintry precip, temps
will plummet below freezing by the late afternoon hours leading to the potential
of a flash freeze and icy concerns. The coldest air of the season will be here
Friday morning with morning temps in the teens!

We rebound temps with sunshine and dry day on Saturday, before heavy rain could
return to the region Sunday. Another blast of cold air follows for most of next
week.

Have a great evening!
