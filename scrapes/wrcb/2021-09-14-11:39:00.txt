Today's weather will be very similar to yesterday with a mostly to partly sunny
sky and high humidity. High temps will range from about 83-88 with heat index
values topping out near 90-92. A couple of isolated showers/storms will be
possible in the afternoon and evening. Clouds will increase overnight with lows
in the mid to upper 60s.

Wednesday then begins our active weather period that will last through the rest
of the week into the weekend. Each day will have scattered showers and storms.
The greatest coverage will happen in the afternoon and evening hours, but there
will be morning time rain on some days, including a few showers possible on
Wednesday morning. Rain probabilities will range from 40-60% generally under a
mostly cloudy sky with highs in the low 80s and lows in the upper 60s.
