Another round of scattered showers and storms will develop this afternoon and
evening. Temperatures will remain warm with highs ranging from 84-88 degrees
across the Tennessee Valley. Rain chances will fade tonight as lows fall to
around 70 degrees.

The upcoming work week will start quietly as high pressure keeps rain chances at
bay for your Monday. High pressure will begin to break down as the week
progresses resulting in higher rain chances Tuesday-Friday. For now, it looks
like the highest coverage of rain will be Thursday and Friday.

Higher rain chances at the end of the week will keep temperatures cooler than
average for this time of year. Highs will return to the lower 80s by Friday.
However, the humidity will be here to stay for the entire week.
