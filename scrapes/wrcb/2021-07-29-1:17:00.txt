It's onto day 8 of the 90+ highs. Look for two more days of this, before a
reprieve comes, beginning Sunday and continues through Tuesday of next week.

Until then, a heat index will be with us all evening. Still at 6PM, a heat index
of 100-101째 is expected, making it a very sticky July night.

Friday will be hotter. The air temperature will reach 97-99째 and the heat index
will reach 105-108째. The criteria for a Heat Advisory for the Tennessee Valley
is 105째 or higher. It's possible a Heat Advisory will be issued for Friday. This
means dangerous heat index values. Please limit time outdoors during peak hours
of 12PM and 5PM Friday, and again Saturday.

A front will arrive on Sunday brining 0.25" to 0.60" and a break. Highs will
return to the upper 80s Sunday, and continue through early next week.

TONIGHT:

6PM: Sunny and Hot, 97 (Heat Index, 101)

9PM: Clear and Muggy, 89 (Heat Index, 94)

Midnight: Clear and Warm, 81 (Heat Index, 85)
