Happy Saturday! Temperatures will fall sharply into the 40s this evening after
the sunsets, setting up for a cold night across the Tennessee Valley.

Our first widespread freeze of the season is expected tonight into Sunday
morning. Temperatures will drop below 32 degrees in the valley with some of the
higher elevations falling into the upper-20s. A Freeze Warning will be in effect
from 3-8 AM Sunday.

Sunday and Monday will remain cool with highs in the mid to upper-50s and
overnight lows in the 30s.

We will begin to warm up by the middle of next week as highs return to the
upper-60s. Another cold front will arrive on Thursday, bringing our next chance
of showers to the area.
