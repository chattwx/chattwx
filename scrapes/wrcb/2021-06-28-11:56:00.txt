Good Morning, 

It will be a hot afternoon with heat indices ranging from 94-99 during peak
hours. Isolated showers are possible this evening, mainly after 5PM for the
Tennessee communities, ranging from a trace to 0.30" tonight. 

It's a Waning Gibbous Moon tonight, coinciding with Saturn and Jupiter. Folks
will be able to see the trio late after midnight until 6AM Tuesday morning.
While we have a wet pattern increasing this week, June 2021 currently in 16th
place for wettest June on record, so far coming in at 5.19" - and with more rain
through the end of the month on Thursday, we'll likely rank higher. The driest
June? 1988 with a total of 0.63", and the wettest June 1949 with a total of
9.48".

There is a 70% chance of tropical formation off the coast of South Carolina in
the next 48 hours. Rain will reach the immediate coasts of South Carolina and
Georgia starting Tuesday. The pattern is looking wet by the end of the week and
heading into the holiday weekend. 

Still too early to pinpoint the specifics, but a few inches of rain is looking
possible at this time. 12PM: Heating up 85, (Heat Index, 91) 3PM: Hot, 90 (Heat
Index 96) 6PM: Hot, 86 (Heat Index, 92)
