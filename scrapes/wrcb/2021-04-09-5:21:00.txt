Good Friday! We end the work week with great weather this morning. We are a
little cooler starting out, but the warm weather returns this afternoon with our
high getting up to 83. Skies will be partly cloudy all day. Pollen counts will
be extremely high.

Tonight clouds will increase and we will have thunderstorms moving through from
midnight on and off through about noon Saturday. The main thing you will
experience will be periods of heavy rain and thunder/lightning. The severe
weather parameters are not that impressive, but the Storm Prediction Center does
have us under a "marginal" risk for severe storms with a 5% chance for damaging
winds and hail, and a 2% risk for isolated tornadoes.

Saturday afternoon we will clear out and be breezy with temps in the low 70s.

Sunday will be amazing with sunshine and a high of 75.

Monday we start the week warm and sunny with temps ranging from 49 to 82.
