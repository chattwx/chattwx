Today will be mostly cloudy to overcast with highs in the upper 60s. The first
part of the day will start with some mist and patchy fog, but overall, it'll be
dry for your outdoor plans. There's a very low chance for a mid-afternoon
sprinkle. However, from about 4pm/3pm CT to 12am ET, a band of light showers
will move across the area from west to east. Total rainfall should be light at
0.1" or less in the valley and 0.1-0.25" in higher elevations.

Monday will be mostly sunny and cooler with highs in the mid to upper 50s.
Tuesday will have some high, thin clouds and highs around 60. Wednesday will be
rainy, highs near 63. Showers will start in the morning and continue throughout
the day at about 0.5-1" of rainfall. Wind will likely be gusty at times, but as
of now, the threat of severe weather and even general thunderstorms is low.
However, it will make for a wet travel day before Thanksgiving. Weather improves
on Thursday for Thanksgiving with a mostly sunny sky and highs near 67, and the
week will end with a partly sunny sky and 65 on Friday. There is still quite a
bit of discrepancy on specifics, but we'll be watching next weekend for a
heavier rain event.
