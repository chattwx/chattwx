Good Morning,

It's a great day for raking, cleaning gutters, and getting outdoor projects
completed before temperatures take a dive next week.

A little breezy at times, but most of the day will be calm. Look for a cool high
of only 57. Tonight will be clear, and lows will dip to the mid 30s. It will be
colder Tuesday morning.

The main weather story this week-the rain and storms arriving Wednesday.

TIMING:

Wednesday afternoon-Wednesday night. Showers will be ending in the morning
hours, likely before daybreak Thursday morning. So, it's looking dry with
sunshine increasing for Thanksgiving Day.

AMOUNTS:

Rainfall amounts of 0.50" to 1" likely-highest rain amounts will be near Marion,
Jackson, Sequatchie and Hamilton counties.

Non thunderstorm winds will be picking up on Wednesday, too. Holiday decorations
could be blown into neighbors yards. While there is not a risk for severe
weather in the TN Valley during this time, there is a risk for severe weather
west. Be advised, strong storms will be possible in west Tennessee on Wednesday.

Rain will be possible again Saturday, and Sunday night-Monday of next week. Lots
of uncertainty with Sunday-Monday, however I'm seeing a big dip in temperatures
next week-nights in the 30s, highs possibly 40s.
