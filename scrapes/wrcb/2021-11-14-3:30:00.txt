Happy Sunday! Temperatures will hold steady in the 50s this evening before
falling quickly into the 40s as the sunsets. Another cold night is in store with
temperatures ranging from 29-33 degrees. Monday will feature mostly sunny skies
and chilly temperatures in the mid-50s.

A warming trend will begin Tuesday into Wednesday as temperatures push back into
the upper-60s to low-70s. A few clouds will be around, but we will stay dry
through the middle of the week.

Our next weather maker will arrive Thursday as a cold front pushes across the
region. A few showers will be around during the afternoon hours before tapering
off by the evening. Cooler temperatures will settle in behind the front heading
into the weekend.
