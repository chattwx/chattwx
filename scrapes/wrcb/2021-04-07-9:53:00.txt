The Tree Pollen is clearly in full swing. Today's count is 3771. Biggest
allergens are Pine, Poplar, Dogwood, and Pear.

It will be a warm afternoon under a partly cloudy sky. Today will likely be the
third consecutive day in a row with temperatures in the 80s.

There is a Marginal Risk for severe weather both Thursday and Friday.

Rain looks to start up around 5AM-6AM Thursday morning. While there is a low
Marginal Risk tomorrow morning, things don't look as impressive as earlier this
week. Some forecast model data is actually trending dry for Thursday. Confidence
is low with tomorrow and Friday's rainfall.

We are coming up on the climatological date for the last frost in Chattanooga.
The median last frost is April 11th.

Temperatures at night over the next week will stay above normal. Nights will
remain the 50s and 40s for the most part. There is however, model data showing
things cooling briefly from April 14th through the 20th, however I don't see
lows dipping to freezing at night.

TODAY:

12PM: P. Cloudy, 72

3PM: P. Cloudy, 79

6PM: P. Cloudy, 78
