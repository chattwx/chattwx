Good Monday. The overnight rain will be clearing out after 8am. Most folks will
be checking their gauge this morning and see .75"-1.5" of rain collected. As the
heaviest rain clears out we may see a few light snow showers in the higher
elevations, specifically the Cumberland Plateau where colder air wrapping around
may interact with leftover moisture to produce a light wintry mix. Roads will be
too warm for any icy conditions. Temps through the day will be in the mid to
upper 40s with blustery winds from the north at 10-15 mph.

Tuesday will be cold all day with temps ranging from the upper 20s to low 30s in
the morning to the low 50s in the afternoon.

I expect more rain showers through the day Wednesday, then more chilly and dry
weather Thursday and Friday.
