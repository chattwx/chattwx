Good Wednesday. The heat engine is cranking up! Temps feel pretty good this
afternoon with clouds and temps in the upper 70s and low 80s. Thursday we will
see some clearing with the high reaching 85. Friday will be mostly sunny and we
will have 89 for the high.

Saturday we will have a dry start to the weekend, but it will be a hot one with
a high of 91. That won't break a record, but we may at least tie the record high
of 93 on Sunday. We could also tie the record high of 94 Monday. Tuesday and
Wednesday will be just shy of a record, but still be hot in the low 90s. There
is a slight chance for a passing sprinkle by the middle of next week. Until
then, just hot and dry.
