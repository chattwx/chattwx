The next isolated shower chance returns on Wednesday morning. Very light rain
from 6AM-9AM is possible with a frontal boundary. Mainly limited to our

morning.

Overall most of the work week is dry!

It will turn colder on Wednesday and Thursday nights, with lows falling to the
mid 30s. Please watch for a Frost Advisory to be issued either one or both of
those nights.

Looking ahead to the weekend, Saturday is looking very wet. Several rounds of

is possible in Georgia near Chattooga, Gordon, and Floyd counties. As Saturday
gets closer, please check back with the Storm Alert Weather Team.
