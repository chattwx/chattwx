Your Wednesday weather forecast is a lather, rinse, and repeat. Once again, the
day will begin with areas dense of valley fog, lasting until about 10am. Then,
it'll be sunny and in the mid-70s at noon with fair weather clouds developing in
the afternoon for a mostly sunny sky with highs in the mid-80s. Tonight will be
mostly clear with patchy fog again and lows in the upper 50s to low 60s.

Thursday and Friday will both have additional clouds for a partly cloudy sky
with highs near 85. Saturday will have a mix of sun and clouds with a small
chance for a PM spotty shower. Rain chances really return on Sunday, and by that
time, we'll need the rain after a dry week and a half. Look for showers and a
few storms particularly from Sunday afternoon into the night. Highs will be in
the low 80s. The rain will continue into Monday with cooler highs in the
mid-70s.
