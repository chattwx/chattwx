Another round of showers and storms will develop this afternoon as a cold front
slowly moves in our direction. Rainfall totals will be highly variable today
with some communities receiving 1-2" of rain while others may not see a drop.
Localized flooding will be the primary concern for your Sunday. High
temperatures will range from the low to mid-80s.

The latest forecast model data suggests that the cold front will stall out
somewhere over our region early next week. Expect higher rain chances to be
around through at least Tuesday. Temperatures will also be below average to
begin the week as highs will range from 79-84 degrees.

Drier conditions will likely arrive by the middle of the week as the frontal
boundary pushes further to our south. High temperatures will also return to the
90s.
