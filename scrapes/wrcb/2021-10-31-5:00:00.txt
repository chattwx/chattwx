Happy Halloween! A few lingering areas of mist/drizzle will be around through 8
AM before coming to an end. We will wake up to mostly cloudy skies this morning
before the sunshine returns this afternoon. High temperatures will range from
60-65 degrees which will be about a 10-degree increase from Saturday's highs.
Trick-or-treating conditions will be excellent with temperatures in the
upper-50s as the sunsets.

Monday will warm nicely with highs in the upper-60s before a reinforcing dry
cold front brings cooler temperatures for Tuesday. Cloud cover will be on the
increase late Tuesday into Wednesday ahead of our next approaching weather
maker.

At this time, it looks like our best chance of rain will be Thursday into Friday
morning. There has been a lot of disagreement between forecast models, so the
precipitation forecast is subject to change. Regardless, temperatures will turn
much cooler by the end of the week with our first frost of the season
potentially arriving this weekend.
