Good Thursday. Moving through the evening we will see cloudy skies with temps in
the mid to upper 70s. I can't rule out a stray shower or two.

Friday and Saturday will both feature primarily cloud cover with highs only
making it into the mid-80s both days. We will also see on and off showers and
thunderstorms both days as well.

Sunday we will begin to dry out as the high rebounds to 90.

We will get even hotter next week with highs of 92 or 93 degrees. The humidity
will also be high with the feels like temp reaching the upper 90s each day. I
don't expect any rain next week until maybe Thursday or Friday.
