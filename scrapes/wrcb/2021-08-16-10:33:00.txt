Tuesday is a Storm Alert Weather Day. Numerous Flood Watches are in effect.
Tuesday morning early we will start to see solid rain from Fred moving in from
the south. The rainfall will be heavy much of the day, beginning to taper off a
bit mid afternoon, and ending all together in the evening. 

Rainfall amounts on the Cumberland Plateau will average between .25" and 1.5".
From Chattanooga eastward we can expect on average 3"-5" of rain with locally
heavier amounts. Many have already seen more than 3" of rain in the past couple
of days, so the ground can't absorb any more and flooding from run off will be a
threat.

We will dry out Tuesday night into Wednesday with a muggy high Wednesday of 90,
and a stray storm or two. Thursday through the weekend we ill stay very humid
with highs in the upper 80s and a few showers or storms possible each day.
