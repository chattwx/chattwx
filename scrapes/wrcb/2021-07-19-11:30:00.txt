Through the overnight we will see widespread rain, heavy at times moving back
into the area. That will last through the morning commute and into the early
afternoon. Through the afternoon we will see the rain dying down with some
showers south of Chattanooga lingering into the evening.. Rainfall amounts will
be of the feast or famine variety. While most will see anywhere from a trace to
1/3", it looks as though the heaviest rain will now in the southern part of our
area.. From Fort Payne to Dalton, to Rome, to Ellijay we could see 1" to 2+"
under some of the heavier cells. Wet roads and very localized street flooding
during the morning commute is a concern.

Tuesday through the weekend we will sport muggy highs of about 90 with only a
slight chance for a shower or storm each day.
