Good Saturday. After a bitterly cold start in the 10s we will warm to a much
more tolerable 47 this afternoon under sunny skies. Sunday will start freezing
in the 20s, but warm nicely to a high of 54.

Another front will move through Sunday night and Monday morning, but it will
only bring a few light rain showers Monday morning. We will get less than 1/10".
The afternoon will be dry with highs in the mid-50s.

Tuesday and Wednesday will be a bit more mild with lows in the 30s and highs in
the low 50s. We will get a few light rain showers Wednesday evening.

Thursday another front will bring in rain all day for New Years Eve. We will
amass 1"-2" with locally higher amounts through the day. Temps will be in the
low to mid-50s all day. The showers will taper off Thursday evening, and as you
ring in the new year it looks like it will be in the 40s and dry by midnight.

Friday, New Years Day, will be colder with partly cloudy skies and temps ranging
from 335 in the morning to 46 in the afternoon.
