It's a splendid start to Thursday with temperatures in the mid 60s under a
partly cloudy sky.

More sunshine is expected today. Highs will top 85-86. No where near the record
high of 97 from 1962.

Staring Saturday the temperatures heat up to 90-91. Once this trend starts, it
doesn't look to let up for ALL of next week.

Heading into June, the high pressure dome that's been building, looks to
flatten, which means for us, warm temperatures, but not quite as hot as we'll
get the last week of May.

TODAY:

6AM: 67: P. Cloudy, Comfortable

12PM: 74, Comfortable

3PM: 85, Warmer, M. Sunny
