After a cloudy and milder morning, clouds will thin by afternoon leading to a
splendid January day! Winds will gust to 15, but overall it looks to be a nice
day for walking/running and enjoying the fresh air, as highs top near 50-52,
just a little cooler than Monday.

As a little wave is moving through this morning, temperatures will take a tumble
tonight to the mid to upper 20s. It will be a cold start to Wednesday with
sunshine, and clouds rolling in late day. It will be colder Wednesday afternoon,
as highs only top 47-49.

THURSDAY-FRIDAY

A storm system will bring rain to the Tennessee Valley by Thursday. Start up
time for showers is about 10AM-12PM. Rain will continue into Thursday evening.
By Friday morning, there is narrow window for brief winter precip of a rain/snow
mix. The surface temperatures in the valley will be in the upper 30s at this
time, meanwhile surface temperatures may be near freezing in the higher
elevations, leading to brief accumulation. Rain amounts of 0.50" to 0.75" looks
good with this system.

Please check back as Friday gets closer for specifics on snow timing and
amounts. The upcoming weekend looks cool and dry.
