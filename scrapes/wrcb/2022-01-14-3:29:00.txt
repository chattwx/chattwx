Good Friday! Clouds will be on the increase this evening with temps dropping
through the 40s into the upper 30s. Saturday will start in the mid 30s and climb
to the mid to upper 40s with overcast skies through the day. We may get a few
showers Saturday afternoon with heavier rain Saturday night through the
overnight.

Sunday we will see the rain changing into a rain / snow mix, and ultimately snow
showers. Roughly we will see 1/2"-1" in the valleys and north GA with locally up
to 2". We will get about 4"-6" in the Blue Ridge Mtns. The Cumberland Plateau
will range from 2"-5" of snow through Sunday. Rainfall amounts Saturday into
Sunday will be about 1" to 1.5". Temps will be in the mid to upper 30s in the
valley so it MAY be tough for the snow to develop in the valley until late. The
later the development, the less the snow.

Monday we will have a few light snow showers early on, clearing late with temps
from 27 to 38. Another front brings more rain and cold air Wednesday.
