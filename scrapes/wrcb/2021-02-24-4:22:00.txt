Good Wednesday. We will be spoiled rotten this afternoon with temps in the upper
60s and low 70s. We should hit 72 in Chattanooga. Skies will be sunny all day.

Thursday we will have periods of cloud cover through the day, and temps will
range from 46 in the morning to 66 in the afternoon.

Friday will be cooler with highs in the mid 50s, but the big deal will be the
start of a rainy period that will see rain all day Friday with scattered showers
Friday night.

Saturday most of the rain will migrate north bringing heavy rain to middle
Tennessee and Kentucky. With that said, we will get some passing shower on and
off through the day. They will just be few and far between. Highs will be in the
mid 60s.

That line of rain will move south through the area Sunday bringing widespread
rain once again Sunday into Monday morning. We will reach 70 Sunday, and cool to
59 Monday.

Rainfall amounts will be around 1.5"-2" in the Tennessee Valley. In Middle
Tennessee they will get 3"-6" of rain through the weekend.
