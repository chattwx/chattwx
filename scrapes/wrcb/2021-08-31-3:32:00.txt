While most of our area has seen anywhere from 2"-4" of rain, there are a few
hotspots that have received up to 6" in the past 2 days. A Flood Watch remains
in effect for our area through Wednesday afternoon. We also have River Flood
Warnings in effect for several of our local creeks and streams most of which
will crest sometime Wednesday morning.

Looking ahead through this evening, we will continue to see steady rainfall
until about 9pm, then the rain will taper to just sporadic showers that will
last on and off through the overnight and into the first part of Wednesday. We
may see another 1/2" to 1" of rain. Wednesday afternoon we will see our weather
improving dramatically. The high will only reach the low 80s. It will be a bit
breezy with winds from the north also bringing in lower humidity. Wednesday
night will be extremely comfortable.

Thursday and Friday will be amazing with lows in the low to mid 60s, highs in
the low to mid 80s, and low humidity both days.

The weekend looks good overall, but we may get a few afternoon sprinkles Sunday.
Otherwise highs will be in the mid 80s, and the humidity will be a bit higher.
