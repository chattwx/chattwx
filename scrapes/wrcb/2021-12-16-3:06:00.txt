Good Thursday. We stay warm and spring-like through Saturday. This evening we
will be in the low 60s with cloudy skies. We will get a few showers during the
overnight, particularly north and west of Chattanooga. They will fade by
sunrise, and most of your Friday will remain cloudy and warm with the high
reaching about 70 once again.

Saturday we will have on and off showers with a few rumbles of thunder through
the day. Temps will range from 57 to 70. Expect widespread 1/2" to 1" of rain
with some isolated areas possibly getting as much as 2". The rain will taper
late in the day, and cooler weather will move in Sunday.

We start Sunday at about 40. We will manage to get to about 50, but most folks
will remain in the 40s.

Next week will remain cool and dry with lows in the 30s and highs in the 50s all
week. The only chance for rain next week is Tuesday as a low passes to the
south. We MIGHT get clipped with a few showers as it passes by.
