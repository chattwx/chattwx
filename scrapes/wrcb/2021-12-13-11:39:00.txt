Happy Monday, everyone!

Our Monday began with cold and frosty conditions, but plenty of sunshine really
helped to warm things up near 60 today. This evening will feature clear and
chilly conditions. Temperatures will fall thru the 40s. Overnight we will bottom
out again near or below freezing with clear skies.

A few extra clouds will increase each day early this week, but temps will also
increase each day. Highs by mid to late-week will be in the upper 60s to around
70 again! Yes, in case you were wondering, that's about 15 degrees above where
we should be this time of year.

Our next weather maker will approach the area by the end of the work week
bringing back rain chances the area by next weekend. A stronger system could
arrive by the beginning of next week with higher rain chances and possibly
another colder trend.
