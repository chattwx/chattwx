Today will continue the weather pattern of cloudy skies, below normal
temperatures, and scattered showers (a few isolated storms too). Scattered hit
and miss light to moderate showers will persist from mid-morning through the
afternoon with isolated heavy downpours. Then, most rain will be done by about
6pm ET this evening. Highs will be in the upper 70s to low 80s with clouds
breaking slightly to mostly cloudy for tonight.

Now onto drier weather! Wednesday through Friday will have a 30% chance for
scattered showers/storms with sunshine breaking through. Highs in the mid-80s on
Wednesday and up to 90 on Friday. The weekend is shaping up to be hot in the low
90s.
