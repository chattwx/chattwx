I hope everyone had a good weekend! The rest of your Sunday evening will feature
a mix of sun and clouds with a few isolated showers around until 9 PM. Skies
will remain partly cloudy tonight as lows drop back into the lower-70s.

In the tropics, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a category 4 storm near Port
Fourchon, Louisiana at 11:55 AM CDT this morning. Impacts from Ida will arrive
here in the Tennessee Valley late Monday evening and persist throughout the day
on Tuesday. Winds gusts of 25-35 mph will be possible Tuesday with 40+ mph gusts
in our higher elevations. Rainfall totals will generally range from 2-4" with
locally higher amounts in our southwestern communities. We will also be tracking
the potential for a few spin-up tornadoes Monday night through Tuesday
afternoon. Be sure to pay close attention to the weather as the remnants of Ida
move in our direction.

Conditions will begin to improve late Wednesday as the rain showers gradually
come to an end. Thursday through Saturday are shaping up to be gorgeous with
cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Overnight lows may even dip into the
upper-50s by the end of the week!
