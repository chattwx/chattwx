Today's weather will be very similar to yesterday, starting with patchy dense
fog in the morning followed by a very warm and humid afternoon. Morning fog will
last until about 10am, primarily along area river valleys. It'll be mostly sunny
in the morning becoming partly sunny by the end of the day. Highs will range
from about 83-88 with heat index values topping out near 90-92. A couple of
isolated showers/storms will be possible in the afternoon and evening. Clouds
will increase overnight with lows in the mid to upper 60s.

Wednesday then begins our active weather period that will last through the rest
of the week into the weekend. Each day will have scattered showers and storms.
The greatest coverage will happen in the afternoon and evening hours, but there
will be morning time rain on some days, including a few showers possible on
Wednesday morning. Rain probabilities will range from 40-50% generally under a
mostly cloudy sky with highs in the low 80s and lows in the upper 60s.
