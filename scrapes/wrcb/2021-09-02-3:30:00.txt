Good Thursday. Let the good times roll! Our weather today has been flawless, and
we will see that trend continue for a few more days. This evening skies will
remain clear with temps falling through the 70s and low humidity.

Friday will be another nice one though we will have more cloud cover. Temps will
range from 64 in the morning to a pleasant 85 in the afternoon.

Saturday will be a tad warmer with temps ranging from 67 to 87 under partly
cloudy skies.

Sunday and Monday will see the humidity creeping back up a little though highs
will remain in the mid-80s. Both days we will have just a few showers or storms
to deal with. They will move through Sunday afternoon, and again Monday morning.
Most of your Labor Day, however, will be nice and dry.

Another front will bring in more showers and storms next Wednesday followed by
another shot of slightly cooler and drier air.
