Good Tuesday. It will be a great evening, but clouds will build through the
night and we will be overcast. That will help keep temps a little warmer
Wednesday morning the upper 30s and low 40s.

Wednesday afternoon will be a great spring day with sunshine returning and a
high of 75. Get the yard work done, though, because changes are a-comin'.

Thursday will sport mild temps in the low 50s in the morning. Clouds and highs
in the upper 60s will follow in the afternoon. Late afternoon into the evening a
cold front will bring in some showers and a few rumbles of thunder. We should
get 1/4" to 1/2" of rain from the system. The BIG impact will be cooler air.

Friday will be much cooler with temps ranging from 42 to 63.

The weekend will be a chilly and dry one. Saturday temps will start in the mid
to upper 30s and only make it to 50 at best. Sunday will start colder in the low
30s and rebound to the low 50s. It looks like that chilly weather will linger
into next week as well.
