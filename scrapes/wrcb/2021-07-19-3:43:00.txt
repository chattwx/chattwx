Good Monday. It's been a rainy one. Lots of folks have seen more than an inch in
the past 24 hours. Parts of Grundy, Sequatchie, and McMinn counties have seen
2"-3" in that time frame. Heading through the evening we will be a little
quieter. Skies will remain cloudy, and a shower or two could still pop up, but
nothing widespread.

Late tonight through the overnight that will change. We will see widespread
rain, heavy at times moving back into the area. That will last through the
morning commute and into the early afternoon. Through the afternoon we will see
the rain dying down. Rainfall amounts will be of the feast or famine variety.
While most will see anywhere from 1/4" to 1". Some stronger cells could dump
2.5"-3.5" of rain through the day. Due to the recent rainfall, I would expect
some areas to experience localized flooding. Street flooding during the morning
commute is a concern as well.

Tuesday night into Wednesday looks dry except for a few showers south of
Chattanooga. It will be hot and humid with a few clouds and a high of 89.

Thursday through the weekend will also sport muggy highs of about 90 with only a
slight chance for a shower or storm each day.
