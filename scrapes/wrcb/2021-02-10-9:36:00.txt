Winds remain light from the south around 3-8 mph today. Temperatures will warm
to the mid 60s again today, making it an excellent afternoon to play outdoors
with the kids today.

Rain returns tomorrow, and umbrellas will be needed by morning. Rain arrives for
the morning commute, and picks up mid morning tomorrow. A few thunderstorms are
possible, but limited to south of Chattanooga for our folks in Georgia and
Alabama. There is not a risk for severe weather Wednesday.

Rainfall amounts of 0.50" to 1" possible in Tennessee, while where thunderstorms
occur south, 1" to 2" looks possible.

The next two nights are rather mild, too! It will only drop to 50 tonight in the
city, and 40s elsewhere. Overall today and this evening are great times to open
up windows, and soak up the fresh air.

By weekend, rain showers look likely Saturday, however the potential for winter
weather is lowering. Sunday night temperatures drop to the mid 20s in the city,
with arctic air to the west near the Cumberland Plateau. It's possible at this
point, the arctic air won't reach most of the TN Valley, and limited to those
west of I-75 next week.

TODAY:

12PM: M. Sunny, south 3, 57

3PM: Few Clouds, south 7, 68

6PM: Increasing Clouds, south 5, 60
