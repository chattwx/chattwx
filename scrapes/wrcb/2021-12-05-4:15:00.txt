Happy Sunday! Temperatures will start in the upper-40s to lower-50s before
warming into the 60s this afternoon. Scattered showers will develop throughout
the day, but any rain chances will be very hit or miss. Temperatures will remain
mild tonight as lows drop into the mid-50s. A few showers will be around after
midnight.

Widespread rain will arrive between 6-11 AM Monday as a cold front approaches
from the west. A few isolated strong storms will be possible along the cold
front, but it is a low-end chance. Conditions will improve by the afternoon
hours with temperatures dropping into the 50s as the front passes. Skies will
clear Monday night, and temperatures will fall into the lower-30s.

Tuesday will be much colder with highs topping out in the upper-40s. Cloud cover
will increase during the day on Tuesday with a slight chance of rain during the
evening hours. Scattered showers will be around Wednesday morning before quickly
ending during the afternoon.

Our next chance of rain will be Friday into Saturday as a low-pressure system
approaches the region. Up to an inch of rain will be possible through Saturday
afternoon. Temperatures will once again turn warmer heading into the weekend.
