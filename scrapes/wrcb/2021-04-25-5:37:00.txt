Today's weather will be much nicer than yesterday's. Morning clouds will
gradually clear to partly sunny around noon and then mostly sunny skies for the
afternoon. Wind will be from the north at about 8-12mph. Highs in the upper 60s
to low 70s. A beautiful spring day!

We'll then warm up for the work week. Monday will be mostly sunny with highs in
the upper 70s to 80. Tuesday will have high, thin clouds and a high of 84.
Wednesday will have more clouds - partly sunny - with highs in the low 80s.
Thursday will be mostly cloudy, but it'll still be warm in the upper 70s to 80.
Scattered showers will develop later in the day and continue into Friday
morning. Friday afternoon will be a little cooler at 73 with a partly cloudy
sky.

As of now, next weekend is looking great. A mix of sun and clouds for Saturday
and highs in the mid-70s. Then, mostly sunny and around 80 for Sunday.
