Happy Wednesday, everyone! After another foggy start in spots, we're looking at
some afternoon clearing, along with warm temperatures. We should top out in the
mid 70s.

Clouds will be on the increase tonight, with a spotty shower possible towards
dawn. Overnight lows will only drop into the mid 50s tonight.

Our next front arrives on Thursday bringing a chance for scattered showers
during the morning hours, followed by some possible rumbles of thunder during
the Thursday afternoon and evening hours. Right now the overall severe weather
threat looks very low. An isolated strong storm can't be completely ruled out,
with the main threats being gusty winds and small hail.

Behind this front, look for a mix of clouds and sunshine with highs falling back
into the upper 60s to near 70, and overnight lows back into the upper 40s by
Saturday morning. A warm front lifts through the area Sunday morning, bringing
in warmer air for Sunday into next week, along with off and on chances for rain.
Next week looks to be much more active across the region.

Have a great rest of your Wednesday!
