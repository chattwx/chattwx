Happy Sunday evening! Spotty downpours will gradually come to an end during the
early evening hours. It will be a steamy evening with high humidity and
temperatures holding steady in the mid-80s. Skies will clear out tonight as lows
drop to around 70 degrees. Patchy fog will develop between 3-9 AM.

High pressure will result in mostly sunny skies Monday and Tuesday. It will be
quite hot as temperatures top out in the lower-90s. Heat index values will
likely reach 100 degrees during the late afternoon hours.

We will reintroduce rain chances Wednesday through the upcoming weekend as more
moisture moves back into the area. Highs will remain seasonable, ranging from
86-90 degrees each day. Overnight lows will range from 67-72 degrees.
