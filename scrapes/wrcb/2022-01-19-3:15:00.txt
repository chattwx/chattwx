Good morning, although there was a lot of snowmelt yesterday, please continue to
use caution on untreated mountain roads this morning for residual slick spots,
especially on shaded roads that did not receive sunshine.

Today will have a mix of sun and clouds in the morning with clouds increasing
for the afternoon, becoming mostly cloudy. Highs will be in the low to mid-50s,
making it the warmest day of the week. A few, light stray showers will be
possible during the daytime. Then, widespread rain will move across the area
from west to east tonight from about 8pm to 3am ET. The heaviest rain should be
in Chattanooga around 10pm-12am. Embedded general thunderstorms will be possible
along the leading line. Residual light rain, wintry mix, and freezing drizzle
will be possible on the backside of the system during the morning hours of
Thursday. Please, especially use caution along the Cumberland Plateau for slick
driving conditions.

Thursday will be a very chilly day with highs only in the mid-30s. Thursday
night will drop down to the upper teens to 25 degrees. Friday will have some
sunshine, but it will still be very cold, topping out at only 34. Saturday
morning may be the coldest in the mid-teens to low 20s. A few light snow showers
and flurries will be possible both Friday and early Saturday for our far eastern
communities if enough moisture gets here.
