Good Morning,

Over the last 12 hours, Hamilton county has picked up close to 0.50" - areas
like Walker County have picked up near 1" since last night. The pattern is
certainly a wet one this week. We're expecting an additional 1" to 2.5" this
week through Friday.

HIGH HUMIDITY:

The humidity will stay high all week too, as dew points stay in the 70s.

While the pattern is wet this week, there is still not a risk for severe weather
Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday at this time.

ALLERGY REPORT:

It's a great report for Today's Allergy Index. Take a look. AQI is low, tree and
grass are low, and mold is low.

LOOKOUTS:

Those headed to the Lookouts games this week will need to watch for rain and
scattered thunderstorms. There is a chance for an isolated shower/storm by game
time tomorrow.

TODAY:

12PM: Light Rain, 77

3PM: Rain/Storm? 82

6PM: Rain/Storm? 80
