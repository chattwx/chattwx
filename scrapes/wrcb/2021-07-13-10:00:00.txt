There is not a risk for severe weather today, but there will be showers
developing in the afternoon. A few thunderstorms can't be rule out. Especially
along the Cumberland Plateau. Rainfall total of a trace to 0.30" possible.

Rain will be possible overnight into Wednesday morning, but coverage will be
minimal, and organized storms don't look likely.

The rain chance is lower on Wednesday, therefore temperatures heat up tomorrow
in the upper 80s near 90.

It will be hot Thursday through Sunday, as temperatures flirt with 90Â° in the
afternoons. I don't see a break in the high dew points coming, therefore expect
heat indices in the mid 90s - especially if you plan on heading to the sunflower
farm in Ooltewah this week!
