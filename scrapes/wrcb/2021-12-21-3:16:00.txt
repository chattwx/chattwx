Good Tuesday. Winter has begun!! We start the season very appropriately with
temps this evening chilly in the low 40s dropping through the 30s overnight as
skies begin to clear out.

Wednesday morning we will be in the upper 20s and low 30s. Most will only reach
the 40s, though we may make it to 50 in Chattanooga.

Thursday will start even colder with a low of 29. However, we will start a
warming trend in the afternoon with the high making it into the upper 50s.

Friday will be warmer for your Christmas Eve. Skies will be cloudy with temps
ranging from 36 to 63. We may get a stray sprinkle overnight, but they will be
few and far between.

Christmas Day (Saturday) will be even warmer with cloudy skies and a high of 70!
A stray sprinkle may pop up at some point during the day, but anything would be
very isolated.

The warm weather will last for a while with highs around 70 at least through
next Tuesday.
