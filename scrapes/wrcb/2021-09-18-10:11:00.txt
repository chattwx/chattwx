Rainfall amounts of 1-5" fell across the Tennessee Valley today, leading to
areas of flash flooding. The rain is beginning to taper off and only a few
showers will be around during the overnight hours. The potential for heavy rain
will ramp back up for your Sunday, which is why we are going with a Storm Alert
Weather Day tomorrow. This is just for localized flash flooding. There is NO
chance of any severe storms for Sunday!

Periods of rain and thunderstorms will continue Monday and Tuesday with high
temperatures remaining around 80 degrees.

A cold front will arrive just in time for the first day of fall Wednesday. Rain
chances will dwindle by the afternoon, and drier air will begin to filter into
the area Wednesday evening. Humidity will take a nosedive overnight as
temperatures turn much cooler. This cold front will set up a spectacular end of
the week with highs in the mid-70s and overnight lows in the lower-50s!
