Today begins our week long trend of more sunshine and higher temperatures. Today
will have lots of sunshine and blue sky and only a few clouds. Highs will be in
the mid-80s with a southeasterly breeze. Wind will gust around 20mph for the
afternoon. High school graduations this evening will be warm in the low 80s, but
still in the mid-80s if you're taking pictures beforehand. Overnight will have a
clear sky and lows in the upper 50s to 60.

Friday will have abundant sunshine with a stray cloud here and there. Highs will
reach the upper 80s. Friday night graduations will range from 89-85 degrees from
5 to 8pm. Then, Saturday will top out at 90 with a mostly sunny sky. Sunday will
be mostly sunny again with highs in the low 90s. Monday will remain mostly sunny
and hit 94. I think Tuesday will be the warmest day with a high of 95. By
Wednesday, some clouds will build in for a mostly sunny to partly cloudy sky
with highs near 93, and an early look at next Thursday has a chance for a few
scattered showers.
