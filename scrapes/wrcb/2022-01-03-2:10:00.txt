Happy Monday, everyone! It's been a cloudy, cold, and breezy afternoon across
the area. This evening, look for gradually clearing skies. Temperatures will
slowly drop through the 30s. As temperatures drop below freezing quickly this
evening, higher elevation areas will need to be alert for some re-freezing of
any leftover snow cover and moisture. Otherwise, look for clear skies overnight
with a hard freeze area wide. Overnight lows will drop into the mid 20s.

Tuesday will feature plenty of sunshine! After a cold start, look for temps to
rebound into the upper 40s to near 50. A mix of clouds & sunshine return for
Wednesday with even warmer temperatures. We're back with highs in the low 50s.

Our next weather maker arrives on Thursday. Rain showers will become scattered
across the area, and as a strong arctic airmass dives into the area, some of
those rain showers will become mixed with snow showers. Especially across the
higher elevations.

The coldest morning of the season likely arrives by Friday, with many areas
starting off in the teens & low 20s. Highs on Friday will only be in the 30s.

We're looking at split weekend on the way! Mostly sunny & near normal on
Saturday, with clouds and rain arriving for our Sunday.

Have a great evening!
