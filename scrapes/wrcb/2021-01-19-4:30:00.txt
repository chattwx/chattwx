Good Tuesday. We will have really mild weather this afternoon with the high
reaching the mid-50s. Skies will be mostly cloudy, but the rain chance is less
than 10%. Wednesday will be nice as well with mostly sunny skies and temps
ranging from 35 in the morning to 53 in the afternoon.

Thursday I expect some scattered light showers on and off through the day. We
could get anywhere from a trace up to 1/4". Temps will be mild all day. 40 in
the morning. 54 in the afternoon.

Friday we will have heavy rain moving by south of the city. That could bring up
to 3/4" of rain Friday for our north Georgia counties. The high will again reach
54.

Saturday looks good. We will start in the upper 20s and low 30s, and climb to a
nice high of 52. Sunday we will have more rain moving in Sunday evening into
Monday.
