Good Tuesday. Skies should be fairly clear as we head through the evening. We
will drop through the mid to low 80s this evening and keep going into the low
70s by Wednesday morning.

Wednesday will be another scorcher with a high of 94, and the heat index
settling at 99. We will get a few pop-up showers or storms that could produce
heavy rain in the afternoon.

Thursday will be a little less hot with a muggy high of 90. We will again get a
few afternoon showers or storms.

Friday will reach 89 for the high. The rain chance is low, only 10%.

Saturday and Sunday may see one or two showers, but overall it will be a warm,
nice final weekend of August.
