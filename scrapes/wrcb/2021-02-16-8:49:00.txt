While there is not a Winter Weather Advisory as of 9:30AM, please be advised
that road temperatures are below 32 from I-75 and west. A band of snow has
developed this morning along the plateau, around 4:30AM-5AM, and this snow is
still ongoing in the higher elevations, and impacting some of the valley. This
will stick on secondary and untreated roads this morning.

Unfortunately, I see clouds with us most of the day now. We may hit 33-34, but
it will be brief. Tonight will be very cold near 19-20Â°.

Wednesday morning and afternoon looks quiet, but another storm system moves in
Wednesday night into Thursday afternoon. Initial onset of precip will be a
rain/snow mix on Wednesday evening around 6PM-8PM, then transitioning to rain by
midnight and continuing into Thursday morning. Rainfall amounts of 1" to 2"
looks good with the highest values along the Cumberland Plateau.

Note - areas west will get snow by Wednesday evening like Memphis, Jackson, and
Nashville areas. Thursday will likely be a Storm Alert Weather Day due to heavy
rain and ponding on roads. We will watch temperatures very closely Wednesday
night, but at this time it looks like the valley will be above freezing. Please
stay tuned as conditions can rapidly change.

TODAY:

12PM: Light snow, 26

3PM: Cloudy, 30

6PM: M. Cloudy, 28
