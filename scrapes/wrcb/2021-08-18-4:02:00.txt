Today is the day for drying out and the return to August heat. It will begin
with a mostly clear sky with the exception of patchy dense fog developing in the
typical valley locations. Clouds will increase, becoming partly sunny for the
afternoon. A few isolated storms will pop-up in the afternoon into the evening,
but overall, a much drier day. Highs will be in the upper 80s to 90.

Then, tonight a line of storms will approach our area from the west, bringing
pockets of heavy rain and gusty wind to the Cumberland Plateau. The storms will
fade out as they move eastward with lows in the low 70s.

Thursday will have numerous showers and storms both in the AM and PM. Storms may
produce heavy downpours causing isolated flooding. Highs will be cooler again in
the mid-80s. Friday and Saturday will have additional scattered showers/storms
with highs in the mid-80s. Sunday will be hot near 90, partly sunny with a few
afternoon pop-ups.
