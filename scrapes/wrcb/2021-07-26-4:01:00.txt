Monday's weather will begin quietly, but you'll notice as soon as you step
outside that it's super muggy. We'll be dealing with very high humidity for the
Tennessee Valley throughout today. During the morning hours, it'll be mostly
sunny with a slim spotty shower chance along the plateau, hitting the mid-80s by
lunch. Active weather will then develop from about noon to 8pm ET with numerous
hit and miss showers and storms (60%). Rain will briefly cool temperatures down.
Otherwise, it'll be partly sunny with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s -- the
heat index as high as 99. Rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an
inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms at 1-2".

Tuesday will be very similar in the low 90s with scattered showers and storms.
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday will be very hot with highs in the mid-90s and
heat indices around 100. All three days will mainly be dry with lots of
sunshine, so really try to get outdoor work and activities completed during the
morning hours.
