Today is going to be the perfect day to spend outside with lots of sunshine.
It'll be cool to start this morning, so jackets will be needed. Then, Saturday
will have pleasant afternoon highs in the upper 60s to 70. Wind will be from the
southeast at 5-10mph. Clouds will increase overnight with milder lows in the low
50s. 

Showers will move across our area from west to east from about 5AM to noon on
Sunday morning associated with a cold front. During this time, it'll be breezy
with wind gusts up to 30mph in the valley and 50mph in the higher elevations.
Once the front passes, the rest of Sunday will be nice with clouds clearing, so
you can spend the afternoon outside. Highs will be in the mid-60s, wind from the
NW, and total rainfall from the morning will be a Trace-0.25".

The highlights for the work week will be sunshine, dry weather, and cooler
temperatures. Monday through Thursday will be sunny with highs from 58-62 and
lows in the mid-30s to 40. Friday will be a little warmer in the mid-60s and
mostly sunny.
