Good morning, today will have more clouds with similar highs as yesterday from
50-55. Expect intervals of both clouds and sunshine with a chance for a few
spotty light showers/sprinkles this afternoon and evening. Overnight will become
mostly clear with lows around freezing.

Friday will be partly cloudy and cooler again with highs only in the 40s. As we
head into the weekend, the first part of Saturday will be relatively calm with
highs in the upper 40s to 50 with a few light showers. More consistent
widespread rain will move in for the evening and continue overnight. We're still
keeping a close eye on the track of this system with the possibility of a
transition to wintry mix and snow overnight and through the day on Sunday. The
winter precipitation will be more likely for higher elevations than valleys.

By Monday morning, it'll certainly be very cold again in the 20s, and you'll
need to watch out for patchy black ice. Highs on Monday will only be in the
upper 30s to low 40s.
