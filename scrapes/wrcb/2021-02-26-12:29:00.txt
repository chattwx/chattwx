A slow moving warm front will continue to lift this evening. This means, our
high temperature of 52-54Â° won't occur until around midnight!

This also means, rain will continue for evening drive time as this front
continues to lift.

The good news -any shower activity tomorrow should stay mainly north near I-40.
Saturday will keep clouds but with a mild high near 70-71.

Most of Sunday will be dry, too, however it will 'feel' a bit more humid as dew
points rise to the 60s. A cold front approaches on Monday night, and showers,
perhaps some thunderstorms arrive late after 8PM or so. This will bring heavy
rainfall of 1" to 2-3", which is on top of the 0.50" to 1.5" we get today. As of
1PM the airport had picked up 0.57", and that is since 3AM this morning.

Monday of next week is looking wetter due to the front arriving Monday morning.
A Flash Flood Watch will likely be issued over the weekend for Sunday - Monday.
Please check back with our team, and make sure you have a way of getting Flash
Flood Alerts for your phone. A Weather Radio is an excellent tool for getting
alerts.
