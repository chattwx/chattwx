The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed the Tennessee Valley into a
marginal risk area for severe storms tonight. This is the lowest risk on a 1 to
5 scale. Showers and storms will develop and some of them could turn into either
strong or severe storms. There is also a fairly good chance that some of these
could have heavy rainfall amounts. Strong gusty winds are the biggest threat
tonight.

Showers will be ending on Tuesday with skies gradually clearing and cooler air
will move in. Highs will be near 80 with lower humidity. Tuesday night will be
clear and cool with lows near 60. Wednesday will be warm with highs in the mid
80's and lots of sunshine. Humidity levels will be tolerable. Little change is
expected for Thursday.

Friday will be a bit more humid, but not that hot. Skies should be partly
cloudy. This weekend will be more humid with isolated showers on Saturday with
highs in the mid to upper 80's. Sunday will see scattered showers and storms
developing along with highs in the upper 80's. Next Monday could be quite wet
with highs in the mid 80's. Paul Barys
