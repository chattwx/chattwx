Rain is the name of the game for the rest of Sunday. Showers will move from the
southwest to the northeast across the entire area this evening. They'll start
light with rain becoming heavy at times tonight. Total rainfall at 1-1.5". Wind
will pick-up after midnight and remain gusty through Monday afternoon.

Light rain showers will end Monday morning, and cold air will move in. As
temperatures drop on Monday, the residual moisture will be squeezed out. A
wintry mix will be possible in the morning hours for the Cumberland Plateau. The
greater chance for winter precipitation will come Monday afternoon through early
Tuesday morning with some flurries or just spitting snowflakes in the valley and
light snow showers in higher elevations. Any accumulations will be light on
grassy and elevated surfaces in the higher elevations and northern counties.
Generally speaking 0.1-0.5" of snow with 1" in the highest terrain. A few spots
at 2". While little to no accumulation for the lower elevations. Please, still
be careful driving on Monday evening.

Although not everyone will experience snow, all will have dropping temps. Highs
will be around midnight Monday with daylight morning through lunchtime
temperatures near 40, then falling for the rest of the day through the 30s.
Winter coats will be needed. On Tuesday, highs will only be in the upper 30s to
low 40s and wind chills in the 20s to mid-30s. Clouds will clear. Then,
Wednesday morning will start in the low to mid-20s with afternoon highs around
50 and sunny.
