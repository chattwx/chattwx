We're about to enter an active weather pattern for the next 36 hours or so,
especially for tonight and again Monday night. Here's a general breakdown.

THIS EVENING... scattered showers increase in coverage

MONDAY 3-8am… heavy rain in our northern TN counties with a few embedded
thunderstorms. Light rain south.

MONDAY 8am-3pm… not much happening, some regular on & off showers. It will
become breezy in the afternoon. Sustained wind: 10-15mph, Gusts: 20-30mph

*MONDAY 3pm-12am… likely window of the strongest wind gusts. Gusts at 40mph
possible in higher elevations, especially west of Chattanooga

*MONDAY 8pm to TUESDAY 4am… A broken band of storms will move across the area.
Threat for severe weather is very low to none at this time, but it's something
to watch. Concerns = isolated strong storms, slightly more likely in Georgia and
Alabama

Now, let's discuss temperatures. They will be mild with tonight's lows in the
upper 40s to 50 and Monday's highs near 65.

Tuesday will be a very nice day - mostly sunny and highs in the mid to upper
60s. Wednesday will be in the low 60s with scattered showers, possibly a few
late night mountain flurries. Thursday will feel like winter again with highs
near 45 and partly cloudy.
