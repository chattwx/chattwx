T.G.I.F, everyone! It's been a sunny but frigid January day across the Tennessee
Valley. High temperatures have struggled to climb above freezing in many
locations, with wind chills in the teens and 20s. This evening, look for mostly
clear skies and very cold temperatures. Tonight, clear skies and light winds
will lead to another frigid morning, with overnight lows in the upper 10s and
lower 20s.

Saturday will feature a cold start, but plenty of sunshine a south wind will
help boost daytime highs near 50. That's about 20 degrees warmer than today!
Clouds will be on the increase Saturday night ahead of our next weather maker.
Overnight lows will be in the upper 30s.

Sunday will feature increasing clouds to start, but widespread rain, locally
heavy during the afternoon hours, will overspread the area by midday into the
evening hours. The good news is this system should be all rain, with even the
chance for a rumble or two of thunder. Highs Sunday will be in the lower 50s.

We clear things out for most of next week, with a cool-down to begin the week,
slowly moderating back to normal by late week.

Have a great weekend!
