Before you head out the door this Wednesday morning, grab your raincoat and
check the WRCB radar. We have light rain showers moving into our area from the
south. They'll continue throughout the morning hours. It's mainly light rain,
but there will be a few pockets of moderate rainfall, more likely west of
Chattanooga. The afternoon will have breaks with only an isolated shower chance,
and highs in the low to mid-80s. Then, scattered showers and storms will
increase again for this evening/tonight. Overnight lows from 65-70.

Thursday will be humid, partly sunny, and have highs near 85 with scattered
showers/storms (40%). Friday will warm up more to the upper 80s with scattered
showers and storms again. Saturday should be near 87, partly sunny with some
showers, too. I think we'll see a bit more sunshine on Sunday with highs in the
upper 80s, but a slight chance for pop-up showers and storms will remain.
