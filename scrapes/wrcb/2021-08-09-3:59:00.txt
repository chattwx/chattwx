Good morning! This week's weather will feel like summertime as kids and teachers
head back to school for the first day of class or first full week of classes.
Highs each day will be in the upper 80s to low 90s. It will be muggy all week
long with heat index values from the mid to upper 90s. Thursday and Friday may
reach 100 for the heat index.

 Additionally, each day will have scattered showers/storms. Storms will
primarily affect the PM hours from noon to midnight with quieter weather for the
overnight and morning hours. Mornings should be mostly sunny with partly sunny
skies for the afternoon. Therefore, morning car drop-offs and bus stops overall
should be fine, but afternoon pick-ups and after school outdoor practices for
football, band, etc. will need to watch for downpours and lightning.

As with any summertime storms, heavy rain, gusty wind, small hail, and lightning
will all be possible. Today, the worst storms will stay to our north, but we'll
need to keep an eye on tomorrow for an isolated severe storm risk.
