Happy Sunday! Another cold, frosty morning is in store for the Tennessee Valley
as temperatures start in the low to mid-30s. It will warm up quickly this
afternoon with high temperatures ranging from 61-66 degrees under sunny skies.

A warming trend will take place Monday through Wednesday as highs top out in the
low-70s each afternoon. Cloud cover will build into the area by the middle of
the week ahead of our next weather maker.

A cold front will approach the region Thursday, bringing widespread cloud cover
back to the Tennessee Valley. Rain showers will develop Thursday evening and
linger into Friday morning. Rainfall amounts will generally remain under 1 inch.

Much colder air will settle in behind the cold front just in time for the
weekend. Highs will struggle to push out of the upper-40s both Saturday and
Sunday with overnight lows dipping close to the freezing mark during the
overnight hours.
