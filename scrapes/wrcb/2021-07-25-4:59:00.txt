Another hot and humid day is in store for the Tennessee Valley. High
temperatures will range from 90-94 degrees with heat index values approaching
the triple digits. Widely scattered showers and storms will develop this
afternoon and evening, but many of our communities will remain dry today.

 

Rain chances will increase Monday into Tuesday as a cold front approaches from
the north. Temperatures will still climb into the low-90s despite the higher
rain chances.

Drier weather will settle in on Wednesday-Friday. We could see our hottest
temperatures of the summer as highs climb into the mid-90s. High humidity will
lead to heat index values pushing into the triple digits each afternoon. Be sure
to stay hydrated and enjoy the AC this upcoming week.

In the tropics, we are still monitoring an area of low pressure off of the east
coast of Florida. There is a 50% that this area of disturbed weather becomes a
tropical depression in the next 48 hours.
