Good Tuesday. We are heading into a gorgeous spring-like afternoon with sunshine
and highs in the 60s. More clouds move in tonight as we drop into the mid to
upper 40s. 

I do expect more scattered showers Wednesday morning and a second round of
showers in the late afternoon after a high of 60. It may change to a brief
wintry mix in the evening in the high elevations. Skies will clear Wednesday
night as colder air moves in. 

Temps will drop into the low 30s by Thursday morning. Thursday will pretty
chilly all day. We will only make it to the mid 40s. 

Friday will be seasonably cool with temps ranging from 28 in the morning to 52
in the afternoon. For the weekend we will warm to 52 Saturday with rain showers
Saturday night into Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon the showers should be over
and we will warm to a high of 53.
