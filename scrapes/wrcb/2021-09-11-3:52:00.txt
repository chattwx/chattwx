It has been a fantastic day so far and that trend will continue through this
evening. Skies will remain mostly sunny with a few passing clouds. Temperatures
will hover in the lower-80s through 8 PM before falling back into the 60s
tonight.

Sadly, we are going to trade the comfortable weather for summer-like heat
Sunday. Temperatures will approach the 90-degree mark by the afternoon, along
with increasing humidity. The good news, we will keep plenty of sunshine in the
forecast!

The heat will ramp up Monday and Tuesday as highs range from 88-91 degrees.
Temperatures will generally be 5-7 degrees above average for the first part of
next week. Rain chances will be reintroduced to the forecast Wednesday through
Friday as we watch the potential for tropical moisture to return to the
Tennessee Valley.
