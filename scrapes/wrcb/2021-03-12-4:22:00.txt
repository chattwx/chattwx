Good Friday! We will be spoiled with more outdoor weather today and a toasty
high of 78. Skies will be cloudy throughout the day. A front will drape over the
area this evening and may bring a few light sprinkles this evening into tonight.
Temps tonight will drop into the 50s.

Saturday will be cloudy and cooler with only a slight chance for a sprinkle
throughout the day. The high will reach 69.

Sunday will warm back up to 77, and skies will sport a nice mix of sun and
clouds.

Monday will start a wet pattern that will see a decent chance for rain Monday
through Thursday. Highs each day will be around 70. Lows will be in the 50s.
During that time period 2"-4" of rain will be possible.

We will cool a bit and dry out next Friday into the weekend. Highs will be in
the low 60s.

Spring forward 1 hour Saturday night!!
