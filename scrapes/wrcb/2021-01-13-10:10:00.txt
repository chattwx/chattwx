We've had some gorgeous rime ice photos sent in this morning where freezing fog
was evident. Fog will lift this afternoon for areas in Georgia and east of I-75.
Once the fog lifts, that sunshine will do it's thing, with highs near 50-51
today.

It will be another cold night tonight, in the 20s. If clouds hold off and
freezing fog develops again, there could be another morning of rime ice
developing. If fog holds off, perhaps some hoar frost early Thursday.

After a cold morning tomorrow, highs will reach 50 again.

New model data is bringing in a narrow window for a wintry mix Friday morning.
The better chance for light snow showers looks to be Saturday where a dusting to
1/2" is possible for our Tennessee counties. A little wave could dip down again
Sunday, bringing another chance for a fresh dusting.

TODAY:

12PM: Fog lifting, sunshine, 41

3PM: M. Sunny, 48

6PM: Few Clouds, 42
