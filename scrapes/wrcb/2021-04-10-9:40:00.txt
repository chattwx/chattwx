Welcome to the weekend! First, if you can make a choice of which day to do an
outdoor activity, Sunday will be a better option than Saturday.

Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day. There is a low-end Level 1 Marginal risk for
isolated severe storms today. However, most people will only be dealing with
rain and general thunderstorms. If stronger storms do develop, the primary
threat will be damaging wind gusts, but a brief tornado cannot be ruled out. The
risk for hail is low and will be in isolated cases. It will likely be small hail
from pea to penny size - below severe criteria. Rain and storms will last from
about 8am to 5pm EDT, coming in 2 general bursts. The first from about 8am-1pm
will be widespread rain with a few embedded thunderstorms, moving west to east
and fading out as it moves eastward. Then, the second burst will be scattered
hit and miss showers and storms from about 1-5pm. Total rainfall at 0.25-1".

The early evening will be quiet. Then, a cold front will pass us tonight,
bringing a narrow line of spotty downpours from about 8pm to 2am from west to
east. Today will be breezy with south wind at 10-20mph, gusts at 20-30mph,
stronger in the higher elevations. Highs will be in the upper 60s to low 70s.

Sunday will be the much nicer day of the weekend. Expect sunny skies with only a
few clouds, and highs in the low 70s. Wind will be from the west at 5-15mph.
Monday will be sunny and warmer in the upper 70s. Tuesday will be partly sunny
with highs near 73.
