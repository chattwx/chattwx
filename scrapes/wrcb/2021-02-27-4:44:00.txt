Today and Sunday won't be complete washouts like Friday was, so that is some
good news for outdoor plans. However, there will be times of scattered showers
and a few thunderstorms. Today will have mist in the morning, and then, pockets
of small, on and off showers will be most likely for areas west of I-75/I-59
throughout Saturday. It'll be warm with highs around 70 and southerly wind at
10mph, gusts around 20.

Tonight will mainly be dry with an overcast sky and lows in the upper 50s. The
daylight hours of Sunday will only have a small chance for rain. Otherwise,
it'll be mostly cloudy to cloudy and even warmer with highs near 75. Wind from
the south at 10-15mph, gusts 25-30.

Sunday night into Monday is the timeframe to watch for the next widespread rain
event. It'll start up after 8pm on Sunday and continue overnight. Heavy rain -
leading to possible flooding - lightning, and gusty wind will all happen. A
Flood Watch will go in effect at 4pm EST on Sunday until 1pm Monday for Rhea,
Bledsoe, and Meigs Counties. Total rainfall expected is 1-2" with the higher end
for our north & northwestern counties.

Showers will continue on Monday, fading out as the day progresses, with cooler
temperatures in the 50s. Tuesday will be partly sunny, a high of 56, and some
scattered showers.
