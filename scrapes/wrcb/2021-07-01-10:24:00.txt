We will continue to see on and off showers and maybe a thunderstorm or two
through Friday morning until about 9 am. We won't see severe weather, but a few
heavy showers could move through. Late morning through the afternoon we will see
cooler and drier air moving in. The high will reach 85. Friday night should be
perfect outdoor weather for anything you have going on.

Saturday will be spectacular. We will be cool and amazing in the morning with
temps in the low 60s. Perfect "coffee on the front porch" weather. The
picture-perfect July day will continue with blue skies, highs in the low to
mid-80s, and really low humidity.

Sunday will have another cool start in the low 60s. We will be warmer in the
afternoon with a high of 89, but the humidity should still be low enough to
enjoy the day. The evening will again be nice for fireworks or whatever you have
planned.

Next week the heat and humidity return with a few showers and storms by the
middle of the week.
