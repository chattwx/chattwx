COOL START

Well, it's obviously much cooler this morning, as many have dropped to the 50s
already.

The next few days will provide an excellent time for outdoor projects, car
washes, and walking pups as temperatures and the humidity stay comfortable for
the next 48-60 hours.

The Lookouts play again tonight, and it's looking fabulous with a mostly clear
sky and light north winds.

WET PATTERN NEXT WEEK

Rain chance returns Sunday, and next week is trending wet. Preliminary data does
show a wet weekend leading up to the 4th of July. Until then, enjoy these next
48-60 hours!

TODAY:

6AM: 60 and Comfortable

12PM: 74 and Comfortable

3PM: 86 Warming
