Happy Wednesday! The second day of winter is kicking off with cold temperatures
in the low to mid-30s. A few areas of patchy fog will be around before 9 AM
before the sunshine takes over the rest of the day. Highs will remain very
December-like, ranging from 47-52 degrees.

Tonight into Thursday morning will be the last night that temperatures drop
below freezing for a while. We will fall into the mid to upper-20s under clear
skies. Be sure to grab a heavy jacket before heading out Thursday morning!

A warming trend will begin on Christmas Eve as daytime temperatures return to
the mid-60s. Skies will be cloudy, but rain chances will remain slim for your
holiday plans.

Dreaming of a mild Christmas? Well, you are in luck because high temperatures
are going to reach the lower-70s on Christmas day. There will be a small chance
of an isolated shower or two, but overall your Christmas holiday is looking dry!
