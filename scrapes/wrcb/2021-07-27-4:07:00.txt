It will be super humid all day long. With the high humidity, spots of dense
river valley fog have developed this morning and will last until about 9am. The
morning hours will be mostly sunny with only a spotty shower chance.
Temperatures will climb up quickly, hitting near 88 at noon. The afternoon will
be partly sunny with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s. The heat index topping
out from 100-102. You'll only get relief from the heat if you have one of the
summertime hit and miss showers/storms over your area, which will last from
about noon to 8pm. Like yesterday, the biggest threats will be heavy downpours
and lightning. It'll still be warm in the evening with overnight lows ranging
from 68-74.

For Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the heat will jump up to the next level.
Highs will be in the mid-90s. The humidity will drop slightly, but not enough to
make a big impact. Max heat indices will be near 102-105 each day under mostly
sunny skies. Shade, A/C, and water will be your friend. It'll remain hot on
Saturday with scattered showers, and then cool a bit on Sunday with highs in the
80s with some showers/storms.
