Happy Friday! Here comes the heat! While we will cling to the 80s Saturday (I
expect a high of 89) we will cruise into the 90s Sunday with a high of 91. The
average high is 82. We will stay dry over the weekend with partly cloudy skies
on both days. Fortunately, the humidity will not be that high so it will be a
tolerable 89 and 91. Think dry sauna rather than wet steam room.

Next week we will ramp it up even more. I expect us to tie the record high
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Highs will climb to 94 Monday and 95 on Tuesday
and Wednesday. We will see a few more clouds with a very slight chance for a
sprinkle Tuesday and Wednesday.

Though we won't break records, we will come close with a high of 94 Thursday and
93 Friday. We will see the humidity increase a little by the end of the week
also.
