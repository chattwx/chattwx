Good Thursday. The clouds and warm weather will stick around through the
evening. Temps will drop through the 70s this evening. Overnight we will see a
little clearing, but more areas of fog are likely once again for the morning
commute.

Friday afternoon we will be partly cloudy and very warm with the high reaching
84 (average is the mid-70s.)

Saturday marks the change many of us have been waiting for. A cold front will
bring in a few light showers early Saturday morning with temps in the low 60s.
Rainfall amounts will be less than 1/10" so that will be no biggie. After 9am
all the rainfall will be gone. The rest of the day will see rapidly clearing
skies and cooler weather settling in. The high Saturday will only reach the mid
to upper 60s!

Sunday will be a perfect cool, pumpkin-spice, corn maze kind of day. We will
start in the mid to upper 40s, and climb to the mid 60s for the high.

All next week will be awesome with cool mornings, pleasant afternoons, and no
rain until MAYBE a little next Friday.
