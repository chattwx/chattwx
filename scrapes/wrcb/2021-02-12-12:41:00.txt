Clouds will continue this evening, with very light showers east of I-75 tonight.
Rainfall amounts of 0.01" to 0.10" are possible through 8PM-10PM or so, mainly
south and east of Chattanooga.

Temperatures tonight will hold 8-10 above normal near 40. No winter precip is
expected.

Rain will up tick by Saturday morning. Rainfall amounts of 0.25" to 0.50" are
likely with the highest totals tomorrow east again. Areas such as Ducktown,
Murphy, Ellijay will get the highest totals by Saturday night.

It will be cool and mostly cloudy on Valentine's Day, too, but overall dry.

Rain will head back in Monday evening. Due to falling temperatures on Monday
night, lows look to be near 33-34 in Chattanooga, while areas along the
Cumberland Plateau could drop to freezing. This means, there is the potential
for freezing rain Monday night. New model data is indicating 0.01" to 0.10" by
Tuesday morning for locations like Altamont, Dunlap, and Jasper areas. It is
still too early to pinpoint exact amounts and impacts by Monday night, but know
this is something we are watching very closely.
