This morning was the last morning in the 30s for the next week. With a low of 36
this morning, temperatures starting tonight and through next week will improve
with lows in the mid 40s to low 50s.

WEEKEND

Clouds will increase tomorrow, but with light winds and no rainfall. Saturday is
the pick day this weekend to be outside.

Sunday-winds will be gusting 20-25 mph in the afternoon. A little bit of rain
moves in Sunday evening, bringing 0.01" to 0.20" to our folks in Georgia, with
0.20" to 0.40" to Franklin, Grundy, northern Sequatchie, and the higher
elevations of Monroe co. Thunderstorms are not expected.

NEXT WEEK

Winds appear to be picking back up again on Monday-especially in the higher
elevations near Murphy and the Blue Ridge Mountains.

 

It's looking promising for rain, and thunderstorms on Wednesday. As Wednesday
gets closer, we'll be able to pinpoint the timing. Please check back with us as
Wednesday of next week gets closer.

The wind will be picking up on Wednesday, too. Rainfall amounts Wednesday will
range from 1" to 2" total. Areas just west of the Cumberland Plateau could get
locally higher amounts of 3"-but this is preliminary at this point.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunny, 59
