Chattanooga has made it up to 90 this afternoon for the first time in 2021. If
you're heading outside, it'll stay around 90 until 6pm, and then in the 80s for
sunset at 8:44pm ET. We've been treated to some brilliant sunrises and sunsets
the past couple of days and could have another great one tonight. Overnight will
be mostly clear with calm wind. Most lows will be in the low 60s with a few
outlying spots in the upper 50s.

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday will all have highs in the low 90s. They'll be
mostly sunny in the morning with high, thin clouds, and then, scattered fair
weather cumulus clouds developing in the afternoon. Monday will have lower air
quality again due to ground level ozone. As of now, the forecast is for the
top-end of the "Moderate" category (yellow). Thus, no air quality alert has been
issued. Then, Tuesday and Wednesday will have spotty sprinkle chances. Thursday
will be mostly sunny with a high of 92 and PM isolated showers. Rain chances
will increase to scattered for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We'll certainly
need the rain by then. Friday will still be hot in the upper 80s to 90. Then,
temperatures look to settle back down to the 80s for next weekend.
