Good Wednesday afternoon. The rest of the day will be stellar with temps in the
low 70s and clearing skies. Cool air will continue filtering in tonight. The
Lookouts should get the revised game opener in with no weather issues at all.

We can expect light jacket weather by Thursday morning as we see temps
relatively plunge into the mid to upper 40s (it is May, keep in mind). Thursday
afternoon will be mostly sunny with the high reaching a pleasant 73.

We can expect some clouds to roll in Thursday evening along a front. That front
may bring a few spotty showers here and there Late Thursday night into early
Friday morning. Most folks will get 1/10" to 1/4" at best. It will quickly dry
out, and the rest of your Friday will be awesome. Temps will be cool starting in
the upper 40s and low 50s, and climbing to only 70.

Saturday will be cool also with temps ranging from 50 to 69. I do, however,
expect some rain showers and maybe a rumble of thunder Saturday late morning
into the afternoon. Sunday will start dry day as we warm dramatically into the
mid 70s. I expect some scattered showers and storms late Sunday into Monday.
