Merry Christmas, Everyone! It's been a cloudy but warm day across the region.
High temperatures warmed into the upper 60s to near 70 this afternoon.

This evening, look for mostly cloudy skies and mild temperatures. Overnight lows
will likely only drop down into the 50s. Sunday will feature a mix of clouds and
a bit more sunshine. High temperatures will once again warm to near 70.

The last week of 2021 will begin with mostly cloudy skies and warm & breezy
conditions. Highs will likely warm into the lower 70s, with overnight lows in
the 50s.

This pattern looks to persist through midweek, but increasing rain chances will
also invade the area. Low chances for a shower or two on Monday & Tuesday, but a
stalled front will increase rain chances to likely by Wednesday & Thursday. Some
of this rain will likely be heavy, with totals averaging between 1-2 inches
across the region.

Temperatures will begin to cool slightly behind this system for the end of the
week, but a stronger system looks to arrive by next weekend bringing another
good chance for rain, a few storms, and potentially a pattern change back to
more winter-like conditions just after the 1st of the year.

Have a great rest of your Christmas!
