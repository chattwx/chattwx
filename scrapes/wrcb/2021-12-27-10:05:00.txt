Happy Monday, everyone! It's another warm & cloudy day across the Tennessee
Valley. Look for the clouds to hang tough this afternoon, but temperatures will
likely warm into the lower 70s!

Tonight, look for mostly cloudy skies with some patchy fog developing. Overnight
lows will hold into the upper 50s and lower 60s.

Tuesday will feature more clouds & even a few scattered showers possible. Not a
washout, but a few showers & still warm temps. Highs will warm into the lower
70s.

Wednesday, the 1st of two big storm systems move our way. Wednesday afternoon
into Thursday will feature a few periods of showers & storms. Some of the
rainfall will be locally heavy, and a few isolated severe storms can't be ruled
out by Wednesday afternoon. Wednesday is a Storm Alert Weather Day!

Behind this strong system Thursday, the rain will clear out, but temperature
will stay warm. Highs will return to the lower 70s for Thursday and Friday.

Our more potent second system arrives this weekend bringing another risk for
heavy rain & strong to severe storms. Highs on Saturday will likely be in the
low to mid 70s, but highs by the beginning of next week will likely drop big
time! We could be looking at some of the coldest air of the season arriving into
the New Year!
