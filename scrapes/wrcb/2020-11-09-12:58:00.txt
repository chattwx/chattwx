Clouds will be increasing for Tuesday and we may see an
isolated shower or two develop during the day, but in
general, most of us will remain dry. On Tuesday night a few
more showers could develop especially after midnight. Highs
Tuesday will be in the mid-'70s. Wednesday will be wet with
showers and a few storms likely. Highs should be in the mid
70's again. On Thursday some morning showers will be
possible with skies clearing in the afternoon and into the
evening. Highs will be in the mid-'70s. Friday should be
pleasant with mid-'70s and mostly sunny skies.

This coming weekend could turn wet again with highs in the
mid to upper 60's Saturday and showers ending Sunday morning
with highs in the mid-70's. Monday will be pleasant with
highs near 70 and mostly sunny skies. Paul Barys
