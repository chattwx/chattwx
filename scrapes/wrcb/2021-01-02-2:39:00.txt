Enjoy these mild temperatures for the last bit of Saturday because changes are
in store for tomorrow. Saturday late afternoon and early evening will be
pleasant. Then from about 8pm to 12am, a wave of light, isolated showers will
move across our area from west to east. The late night will mainly be dry with
only a few spots of sprinkles and lows in the upper 30s to low 40s.

Sunday will feel like early January, remaining in the 40s with a westerly
breeze. There'll be a few sprinkles Sunday morning that may transition to
spitting snowflakes in the higher elevations to the northwest until noon. It'll
be mostly cloudy, becoming partly cloudy later in the day.

Monday will be mostly sunny with highs near 55. A few more clouds on Tuesday but
still having sunshine and 55 again. Wednesday will have high thin clouds and a
high of 54. Then scattered rain showers develop on Thursday with highs around
50. Friday will be cooler, only in the mid-40s, and showers will continue with a
little wintry mix in the mountains.
