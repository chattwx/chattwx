Good Wednesday. After a nice spring day, we will start to see more seasonal
changes in the forecast as we head through the rest of the week. This evening
will see clouds building and temps in the mid to upper 50s.

Thursday will start milder in the low 50s. We will climb to about 70 in the
afternoon with clouds and a few afternoon showers. I expect periods of heavy
rain and a few non-severe thunderstorms in the late afternoon and early evening
as well. It might be a dicey commute home Thursday. Rainfall amounts will range
from 1/4" to 3/4"

Friday we clear out with sunshine and a high of only 62. We will get a few
clouds late in the day but no rain.

Saturday will be colder with sunshine and temps ranging from 39 to 50.

Sunday will start even colder with lows in the upper 20s and low 30s.

It looks as though that chilly weather will continue into the first half of next
week as well.
