TODAY:

It only fell to 64° this morning - making it the warmest morning so far of 2021.
We came close to the record warm minimum for today too, which is 66° from 2002.
Even with clouds, temperatures are expected to reach the mid 80s - perhaps
coming close to the record high of 88. 

While most of us will stay dry today, an isolated shower is possible this
evening north of Chattanooga, and particularly near the Cumberland Plateau by
evening drive time.

It will be another warm night with lows near 60-61.

THURS-FRI

Showers still on tap late in the day Thursday through Friday. A few
thunderstorms are possible, but there is not a risk of severe weather. Rainfall
amounts of 0.30" to 0.60" looks good, with the higher totals west of I-75.
