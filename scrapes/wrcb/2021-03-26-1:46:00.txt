Tonight will be quite pleasant with fair skies and lows in the mid-'50s. Clouds
will increase late and a few showers will develop by dawn. As the day progresses
on Saturday, showers and storms will re-form. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC)
says that a few of the storms could turn severe. Highs will be quite warm and in
the mid-'70s. More showers and storms will be likely Saturday night and into
Sunday morning. Again, some of the storms early Sunday could turn severe. Highs
Sunday will be in the upper 60's.

It looks to me like Monday will be dry with highs near 70. Tuesday could have a
few isolated showers with highs in the upper 60's. Wednesday will see showers
likely return with the '60s expected.

Thursday will dry off with a much cooler high near 60. And next Friday will be
sunny with the 60's returning. Paul Barys
