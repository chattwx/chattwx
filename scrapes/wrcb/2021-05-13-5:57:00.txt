Good Thursday. We will have a stretch of picture-perfect weather heading into
the weekend.

Today will be mostly sunny with the high reaching 71. We will have a great
outdoor day Friday with the high reaching 75.

Saturday will be equally nice, though a few degrees warmer at 79. A warm front
will develop over the area which may lead to a few scattered showers Saturday
night through Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon we will be mostly cloudy with a
high of 80.

All next week we will have highs in the low 80s, lows in the low 60s, mostly
cloudy skies, and we will have a chance for a few showers each day.
