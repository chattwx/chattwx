several hours. The heaviest rain will be in our western communities, where an
additional 1-2" of rain will be possible. Areas further east will be dealing
with a few on and off showers through the night. Most of the rain will taper off
by 3 AM. Patchy fog will develop early Sunday morning across much of the area.

Sunday will be mainly dry with only a few showers and storms developing
throughout the day. Temperatures will be hot as highs return to the 90s.

Monday and Tuesday will feature mostly sunny skies and HOT temperatures. Highs
will range from 90-94 degrees with heat index values of 100 degrees during the
heat of the day.

Rain chances will return to the Tennessee Valley on Wednesday and continue
through the weekend. Highs will range from 87-91 degrees each afternoon with
overnight lows dropping into the low 70s.
