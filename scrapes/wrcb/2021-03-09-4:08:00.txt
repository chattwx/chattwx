Good Tuesday. After another cool start, we will have another dramatic warm-up.
Skies will be partly cloudy today as we soar up to 72 for our high. Tonight will
not be as cool with lows in the low 40s.

Wednesday we will make it all the way to 76, and we're not done there. Thursday
and Friday we will see temps starting in the low 50s and climbing to the upper
70s. Skies will be mostly cloudy, but no rain. While our temps are looking way
warmer than normal we would need to hit the low 80s to break any records.

Saturday we will be cloudy, cooler, and could see a few sprinkles late in the
day. The high will cool to the upper 60s (which is still well above average).
Sunday will be mostly cloudy with temps ranging from 51 to 69.

Next week will see mild temps in the upper 60s, and a much wetter pattern with
rain chances increasing Monday through Wednesday.

Spring forward this weekend as Daylight Saving Time starts up Sunday morning.
