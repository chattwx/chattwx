We're almost to rain free weather, but first, there are a few showers this
morning. Areas generally to the east of Dalton/Cleveland will have showers until
about 10am. Simultaneously, locations to the west of Chattanooga had clouds
clear last night, so dense valley fog has formed. Thus, depending on your
direction, you may have fog or rain to deal with this morning. It'll be partly
sunny by lunchtime and clouds will continue to decrease through Friday afternoon
and evening. Highs will be warm today around 80 with a few additional spotty
showers popping up from about 2-9pm.

Tonight's weather will be fantastic for Friday Night Football in the 70s and
mostly clear. Overnight lows will drop into the upper 50s to low 60s. Saturday
and Sunday will be great for pumpkin patches, fall festivals, and anything else
outdoors. Highs will be in the low 80s under mostly sunny skies. Highs in the
low 80s and a mix of sun and clouds with continue for next work-week with a
couple of isolated showers possible on Tuesday.
