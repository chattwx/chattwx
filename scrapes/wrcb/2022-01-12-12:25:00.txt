Happy Wednesday, everyone! Our Wednesday will feature mostly sunny skies a bit
warmer. High temperatures will warm into the 50s. A mix of clouds and sunshine
returns Thursday with just a slight chance for a sprinkle or two. Highs again
warm into the 50s.

Partly cloudy & cooler on Friday with highs only in the 40s.

An interesting weekend weather forecast is on tap for the area. A strong area of
low pressure dives south into the region on Saturday bringing a chance for Rain
& Snow. Still plenty of questions to iron out with this system, but it's
definitely one to watch in the coming days!

Have a great Wednesday!
