Good Wednesday. Heading through the evening it will be muggy with temps in the
70s. We can expect a few scattered thunderstorms this evening until about 11 pm.

Thursday we will get a few passing showers and storms, but nothing widespread.
Friday will be much the same with highs in the mid-80s.

I really don't see much different this weekend. 86 on Saturday. 87 Sunday.
Spotty passing showers and storms are possible on both days.
