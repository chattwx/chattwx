Good morning, we begin Friday with wind chills in the 10s for most of the area,
but in the single digits up along the ridges of the Cumberland Plateau. These
coldest wind chills will last through about 9am ET, and then see improvements
for the rest of the day. Today will have a sun/cloud mixture, especially
experiencing more sunshine at midday through the afternoon. Highs will only be
in the low to mid-30s. Tonight will be mostly clear with cold lows again in the
upper teens to low 20s.

Saturday will be the "pick day" of the weekend for outdoor plans. It'll have
lots of sunshine and highs near 50. In contrast, Sunday will be a rainy day. A
few showers in the morning, so you may have to battle the rain for church. The
more widespread rain will move in for the afternoon. Highs in the low 50s.

Monday and Tuesday will be great winter days with sunny skies and cool highs in
the 40s. Wednesday will warm a bit to near 50, and then hitting 54 for Thursday
with a mix of sun and clouds. For the latest, download the WRCB weather app.
