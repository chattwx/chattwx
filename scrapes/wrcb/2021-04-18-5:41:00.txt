Today will begin cool in the morning with a mostly sunny sky, warming up to the
low 60s for Sunday brunch. The afternoon will have a mix of sun and clouds and
highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. Wind will generally be from the north in
morning and northwest for the afternoon at 5-8mph. A great day to take advantage
of National Park Week or wash some of the pollen off of your car.

Tonight will be mostly to partly cloudy with lows in the low to mid-40s. Monday
will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 70s. Tuesday will be the warmest day
of the week at 75 with some afternoon scattered clouds. Then, comes a cold front
early on Wednesday morning. A few light showers will develop along the front,
but the big weather story will be the drop in temperatures. The official high
for the day will likely be at midnight with daylight temps in the 40s to low 50s
- at least, we'll have a mostly sunny afternoon. Thursday morning will be cold
in the low to mid-30s with frost possible area-wide. Thursday afternoon will
reach the low 60s and mostly sunny. Areas outside of Chattanooga will need to
watch for frost again on Friday morning. It'll warm up to 67 in the afternoon.
More widespread rain showers return on Saturday.
