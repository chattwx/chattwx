Good Monday. It looks like most folks got 1.2" to 1 1/2" from I-75 west while
east of the interstate seemed to accrue 1/10" to 1/3". Skies will be clearing
and temps dropping through the evening. We will drop from the 40s into the 30s
and keep going overnight until we hit the upper 20s and low 30s Tuesday morning.

Skies will be sunny and it will remain cool all day Tuesday with highs in the
upper 40s and low 50s. More clouds will roll in late Tuesday into Wednesday.

We will be a bit warmer Wednesday with temps ranging from 40 to 59. There is a
slight chance for a stray sprinkle or two.

Thursday starts chilly in the low 30s, but we will warm nicely with a high of
61.

Friday and Saturday will be mild with highs in the upper 60s. We will have
showers on and off all day Friday and Saturday with a line of heavy rain and
storms moving through late Saturday. Sunday we will clear out as cooler weather
returns and knocks lows back into the low 30s and highs back down into the
mid-50s.
