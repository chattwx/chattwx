The remnants of Tropical Storm Claudette will continue moving inland spreading
heavy rains across portions of the Southeast tonight and tomorrow. The highest
impacts will stay south of Chattanooga, but the whole area will be dealing with
periods of rain through tomorrow morning. The heaviest rainfall amounts will be
in our Georgia and Alabama communities where 1-2" of total rainfall will be
possible. Conditions will improve for your Father's Day festivities with only a
few spotty showers and storms around during the morning and afternoon hours.

Another round of widespread rain and storms will develop late Monday into early
Tuesday as a cold front approaches the Tennessee Valley. A few severe storms
will be possible with the primary threats being damaging wind gusts. The rain
will move out Tuesday afternoon with cooler temperatures settling in for the
middle of next week.
