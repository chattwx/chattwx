Good Wednesday. IT'S FALL, YA'LL! ...C'mon. I only get to say it one day a year.
I'm even drinking a Pumpkin Spice Latte while I type this!

What an entrance to the season it is. Skies are clearing, the humidity is
dropping, and the temperature is about as nice as you could hope for. Skies will
be clearing this evening with temps dropping rapidly through the 60s!

We will keep going to a low of 52 by Thursday morning. Many outside the city
will be in the 40s. Thursday afternoon we have nothing but sunshine with a high
of 71.

Friday will be another perfect fall day with low humidity, blue skies, and temps
ranging from 50 to 75.

The weekend will also be sunny and amazing. Highs will be in the mid to upper
70s. Lows will bee around 50 Saturday morning and in the mid 50s Sunday morning.

Next week will remain sunny, but warm a bit into the low 80s.
