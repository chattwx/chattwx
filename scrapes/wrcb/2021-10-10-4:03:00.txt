Happy Sunday! Areas of patchy dense fog will be around again this morning,
especially along river valleys. Use caution if you will be traveling across the
area before 9 AM. After the fog lifts, temperatures will warm into the low to
mid-80s under partly cloudy skies. It is shaping up to be another warm October
day!

Above-average temperatures will continue Monday through Thursday as highs range
from 79-84 degrees each afternoon. Rain chances will be low through the first
part of the week, but a weak cold front could bring a few showers to the
Tennessee Valley on Tuesday. Otherwise, skies will range from mostly sunny to
partly cloudy each day.

A strong cold front will trek across the area late Friday into Saturday,
sparking scattered showers. Rainfall amounts look to remain light, but a major
blast of fall air will likely move in during the day on Saturday. Highs will
drop back into the lower-70s with overnight lows returning to the upper-40s.
Sweater weather officially returns next weekend!
