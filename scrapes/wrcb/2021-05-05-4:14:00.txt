Good Morning,

There is 1 River Flood Warning this morning through 7PM for the Chattooga River
near Summerville. A Minor Flood Stage is expected this morning, before falling
below the flood stage later this evening.

There is also Dense Fog ongoing near Murphy and the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Visibility has been reduced to 1/4 mile there. Be prepared for a slow morning
drive for those in the higher elevations east of I-75.

A few hit and miss showers are possible today for our Tennessee communities, but
nothing measurable. 

Overall it will be quiet through Thursday - I'm tracking some rain returning
Friday morning, and next week is looking wet with rain and thunderstorm chances
each day next week.

TODAY:

6AM: 61, Patchy Fog

12PM: Broken Clouds, 70

3PM: Broken Clouds, 73
