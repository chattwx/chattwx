Good Monday. You may see a sprinkle or two as you head out the door this
morning, but they are few and far between. For the most part, it is cool and
cloudy this morning. This afternoon will remain mostly cloudy, but we will have
mild temps in the low to mid-50s.

Tuesday and Wednesday will be awesome. Both days will feature a nice mix of sun
and clouds with highs in the mid-50s.

Thursday, New Year's Eve, will be interesting. Another front will move in and
brings clouds, warmth, and maybe a sprinkle or two Thursday through the
afternoon. The high will reach about 60. Thursday evening we will have heavy
rain developing and slowly moving through Thursday night into Friday morning.
That does mean heavy rain at midnight when we ring in the new year. Rainfall
amounts from Thursday evening through Friday morning will range from 1"-3".
Areas of flooding during that time are possible.

Friday afternoon we will clear out with highs in the upper 50s.

The first weekend of 2021 looks amazing, just like I'm sure the entire year will
be! We will be partly cloudy with his in the low 50s both days.
