Oh how much we've deserved this sunshine and taste of spring! The record high
for today is 79Â° - and while I don't see us reaching this, it will be an
unseasonably warm day with highs 12 to 15 above normal in the mid to low 70s!

It will be a tad more breezy today, too, with winds gusting 15-20 mph by
3PM-5PM. It will be another nice late afternoon to fly a kite with the kiddos as
they head home from school today.

A sprinkle will be possible tonight, but that's it. Expect more clouds with lows
5 to 10 degrees warmer in the upper 40s.

Thursday will be rain - free.

The pattern is still looking wet from Friday through Monday. Rain amounts of 1"
to 3" is still looking good. While showers arrive morning Friday, they taper off
Friday evening. There will likely be dense fog on Saturday morning. A few
showers are expected Saturday, but it won't be a gully washer. That comes
Sunday. Still perhaps and isolated thunderstorm Sunday afternoon.

TODAY:

12PM: Sunshine, 63

3PM: Sunshine, 74

6PM: Sunshine, 66
