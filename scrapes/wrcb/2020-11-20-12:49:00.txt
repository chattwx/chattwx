We will enjoy another very nice one on Saturday. Just a few clouds will stream
across the skies with highs in the upper 60's. Lows Saturday will be in the
upper 40's. On Sunday the clouds will be increasing with highs again in the
upper 60's. A few showers will move through the area by Sunday night, but
amounts will be light. The best chance for any rain will be in Tennessee.

On Monday clouds will be decreasing with highs in the low 60's. On Tuesday skies
just a few more high clouds will move in with highs in the low to mid 60's. The
big traveling day, Wednesday will see showers by afternoon and into the
overnight. Clouds will linger for Thanksgiving Day. Highs will be in the mid
60's Wednesday and Thursday. Friday should be partly cloudy with highs in the
mid to upper 60's. Paul Barys
