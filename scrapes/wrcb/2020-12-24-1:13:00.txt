The change over to a wintry mix has begun in the higher elevations. As
temperatures continue to drop tonight, and snow showers begin, light
accumulation and more importantly, slick areas will become a concern.

East of I-75, is still the best set up for minor snow accumulation. The window
is narrowing to about 4PM to 7PM. Here, 1" to 2" of snow will be possible on
grassy areas, and elevated surfaces.

Road temperatures will begin to drop below 32 for Murphy, by 5PM-6PM, bringing
freezing rain as a threat, too. Road temperatures will drop below 32 in most of
the higher elevations by 7PM-8PM, and in Chattanooga/Cleveland by 9PM-10PM.

The majority of the moisture will have moved out by this time. However,
remainder water on roads will freeze. There will be light snow showers returning
overnight into Christmas morning, too. By this time, road temperatures will have
dropped below 32 for several hours-therefore a dusting will be possible, where
light snow bands set up. Further north in middle Tennessee, has the best chance
overnight.

Then, Christmas Day could be the coldest day of the year. Hard to believe. I am
forecasting a high of 30. So far the coldest day of 2020 was January 20th,
earlier this year where the high only reached 33.

TONIGHT:

6PM: Snow east of I-75, 31

9PM: Cold, 29

12AM: Light snow, 27
