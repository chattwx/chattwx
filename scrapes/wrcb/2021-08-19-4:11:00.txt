As you head out the door this morning, especially if it's before sunrise, keep
in mind that we had heavy rain and gusty wind overnight. There may be standing
water on low-lying roads or tree branches down. 

Now, for your Thursday forecast, today will be mostly cloudy with highs from
80-84. Showers and storms will be likely (70%), but it won't be raining all day.
There will be dry periods. At this point, our ground is saturated, so any
repeated heavy downpours may lead to localized flooding. The flooding potential
is our biggest risk for today. The chance for showers and storms will continue
tonight as well.

Friday and Saturday will experience similar weather in the mid-80s with
scattered showers and storms. Sunday will be hotter again with highs in the
upper 80s to 90 with some pop-up storms. Highs in the 90s will continue for the
beginning of next work-week.
