Good Thursday. We are starting warm and a little humid this morning. This
afternoon will be mostly cloudy with highs in the upper 70s and low 80s. We will
hit 83 in Chattanooga.

After 5pm a cold front will spark scattered thunderstorms. There is a chance
some storms could produce damaging winds so spotty power outages, as well as
downed tree limbs, are a possibility. Rainfall will be hit and miss with some
areas getting about 1/2" and others getting less than 1/10".

Friday will be amazing. We will start with temps in the mid to upper 50s and
climb to a high of 78 with lots of clear blue skies.

Saturday will be cool starting out with morning temps in the upper 40s and low
50s. We will again see lots of sunshine with the high reaching 79.

Sunday will be cloudy with a high of 81.

More showers and storms will return to the forecast for the first half of next
week.
