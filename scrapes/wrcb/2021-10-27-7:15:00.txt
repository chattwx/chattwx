Happy Wednesday, everyone! It's been a beautiful day across the area with a mix
of clouds and sunshine. Clouds will be on the increase this evening, as a potent
storm system approaches from the west.

Thursday will feature periods of rain, heavy at times, and gusty winds. Be sure
to pack the rain gear and patience for Thursday. Right now, any threat for
organized severe weather looks to remain to our south. Temperatures will remain
chilly with highs only in the 50s to near 60.

The rain does not really clear out completely, leading to more scattered
showers, clouds, and chilly temperatures for Friday and Saturday. Thankfully,
things look to clear out for Halloween, including for Sunday evening during the
prime trick-or-treat times.

Next week will feature a mix of clouds and sunshine with highs warming back into
the upper 60s and lows in the 40s.

Have a great evening!
