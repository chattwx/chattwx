Clouds will continue to decrease through the rest of Sunday afternoon into the
evening with pleasant spring temperatures. Sunset is at 8:22pm EDT and will be
around the mid-60s. April's full Moon is tomorrow night, but with a clearing sky
tonight, you should have an excellent view of the almost full Moon. Overnight
lows will be in the low to mid-40s with patchy fog developing.

Monday will be warmer with highs in the upper 70s to 80 and a southerly breeze.
Expect plentiful sunshine early with some thin clouds moving in later in the
day. Tuesday will have high clouds mixed with sun and highs in the low 80s - 84
in Chattanooga. Wednesday will be partly sunny to mostly cloudy and still warm
in the low 80s. Thursday will be mostly cloudy, hitting the upper 70s to 80.
Then, scattered showers will move into our area for Thursday evening into Friday
morning. They look to be done by Friday afternoon with a partly sunny sky and
highs in the low 70s.

As of now, next weekend is shaping up to be dry. A mix of sun and clouds for
both Saturday and Sunday - highs in the mid-70s and upper 70s, respectively.
Rain chances return Sunday night.
