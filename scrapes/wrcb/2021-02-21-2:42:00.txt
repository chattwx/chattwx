Wow, what a fantastic weather day! Enjoy this last bit of weekend. It'll remain
dry for outdoor plans with clouds increasing this evening, especially after 9pm
EST. 

Tonight, isolated light showers and sprinkles will develop to the southeast
around midnight and increase through the early morning hours of Monday. Then, a
more widespread rain system will enter our western counties associated with a
cold front. Peak timing for the greatest rain on Monday will be from about 6am
to noon EST from west to east. On average, 0.2-0.5" of rainfall, with higher
totals possible along area mountains. By 1pm, rain should be done, and clouds
will be clearing for sunshine in the afternoon with highs from 54-59 for most.

Tuesday and Wednesday will feel like spring with sunny skies. Tuesday in the low
60s. Wednesday near 68. Thursday will be partly sunny with a high of 60 and a
chance for a few light morning showers. As of right now, for Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday, no one day will be a complete washout, but each day will have times
of scattered rain showers. Friday near 54 and then Saturday and Sunday warmer
around 60.
