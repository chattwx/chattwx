Good morning, we have 2 focal points for our area over the next 24 hours: a cold
front bringing rain followed by cooler temperatures and the "near-total" partial
lunar eclipse overnight.

First, the cold front will have rain on either side of it. Moving from west to
east, it'll produce on and off scattered showers from about 8am to 6pm ET. For
any given location, there will be dry periods today. Rain totals will average
0.1-0.25" with higher possible along the plateau and some locations only
receiving a trace. Highs today will be near 64 and will fall after the front
passes. It'll pass over Chattanooga around noon, so the high today should be at
midday and then cooler by 3pm.

Second, most clouds will clear out of our area by midnight with the exception of
a few high thin clouds in Georgia. Therefore, we should have a good view of the
partial lunar eclipse. It will essentially look like a total eclipse as 97% of
the Moon will be in Earth's center shadow. The partial eclipse will begin at
2:19am ET, peak at 4:03am (reddish Moon color), and end at 5:47am. You'll want
to look at the western sky and dress warmly as it'll be in the 30s.
