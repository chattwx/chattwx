Light rain showers and times of wintry mix will increase from the south this
afternoon. Then, a transition to snow for the Blue Ridge Mountains and ridges on
either side of the Sequatchie Valley will happen by about 5/6pm. This valley
rain and higher elevation snow will continue until about 10pm, moving northward.
There will be a slight break period, and then, a second system will approach
from the west, bringing wintry mix and snow for the Cumberland Plateau. It will
move eastward from 11pm until about 8am, bringing mainly snow for the higher
elevations and a rain/snow mix in the valleys.

Snowfall: Eastern mountains and the western Cumberland Plateau... 1-3",
Mountains/ridges closer to Chattanooga (Lookout, Signal, etc)... 1-2", and then,
lower amounts expected as you come down ridgelines back to the valley. Most of
the valley will have temperatures above freezing the entire time, so in general,
no snow accumulation is expected. However, a quick burst may produce a dusting
on grassy and elevated surfaces, most likely in McMinn County.

Roads: Valley roads should remain fine. Higher elevation roads, overpasses, and
bridges may become slick, especially with the snowfall overnight, so please use
caution.

Tonight's lows will range from freezing to the mid-30s.

The system will be done by about 8am on Sunday morning. Then, low level clouds
will slowly decrease, becoming partly cloudy with highs in the mid-40s. Monday
will be mostly sunny and warmer in the mid-50s. Tuesday and Wednesday with highs
around 60.
