Good morning, the rain of yesterday is long gone, and it has been replaced with
cooler, drier air. There may be very isolated patches of black ice this morning,
but overall, the gusty wind of last night should have dried most spots up. Today
will have a brisk breeze from the north at 10mph with gusts around 20mph,
especially this morning. It'll be a pretty day with abundant sunshine and cool
highs in the mid-40s. If you plan to watch the National Championship football
game on an outside TV or projection screen, it'll be in the 30s. Overnight will
be clear and cold with lows dropping into the low to mid-20s.

Tuesday will be sunny again, reaching near 45. Another night of lows in the 20s
will follow. Wednesday will be a bit warmer with highs near 50 and a few high
thin clouds. Thursday will be partly sunny, topping out in the low 50s. There's
a slim chance for an isolated shower in the north, but overall the 5 days of the
work/school week will have very quiet weather. Friday will be partly sunny with
highs in the low 50s. Saturday will be our next best chance for showers.
