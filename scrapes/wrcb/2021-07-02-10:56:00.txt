Good Morning,

Cold front has cleared our Tennessee communities, where humidity has begun to
drop! We'll really notice the difference this afternoon and evening for
Chattanooga. But it will be a splendid night for fireworks and camping.

As the weather remains quiet through the holiday, we can shift our attention to
Hurricane Elsa.

 

Elsa is a Category 1 Hurricane on the Saffir Simpson Scale. The storm will
weaken to a Tropical Storm by Sunday-Monday nearing Cuba, before winds and rain
begin in Florida Tuesday-Wednesday of next week. It does look likely that Elsa
will be a Tropical Storm by the time the storm reaches the Florida Panhandle.
