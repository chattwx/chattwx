Today we get a slight break from the rain during the morning hours and early
afternoon with only a few stray sprinkles here and there. Then, scattered
showers will develop in the afternoon into the evening. Unlike the past 3 days,
these will be hit and miss. Tuesday will be mostly cloudy overall with highs in
the upper 70s to low 80s.

A few scattered showers will continue tonight, and then rain will really
increase tomorrow morning along a cold front. The key window for rain/storms on
Wednesday will be 6am to 1pm from west to east. Rain will be heavy at times with
gusty wind - rainfall at 0.5-1" on average. For Wednesday afternoon on the
backside of the system, wind will be coming down from the northwest, lower
humidity filtering in, clouds partially clearing, and only spotty showers.

Then, it's smooth sailing for the rest of the week in weather. Sunny skies and
cooler temperatures on Thursday and Friday with lows in the 40s/50s and highs in
the low 70s. Saturday and Sunday will be a bit warmer in the mid to upper 70s.
