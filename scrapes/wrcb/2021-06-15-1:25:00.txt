Temperatures will remain near normal for the rest of this week. Sunshine will be
abundant Wednesday through Friday. Highs will be in the mid to upper 80's to
near 90. Saturday and Sunday will continue with highs in the mid to upper 80's
and a few scattered showers or storms could form during the heating of the day.

Next week will remain warm with highs in the upper 80's to near 90 along with
scattered showers and storms. The best bet for the storms will be in the
afternoon and evening hours. Paul Barys
