Happy Friday, folks!

Welcome to the end of 2021. Isolated showers and a few storms will be possible
today, but overall, New Year's Eve plans should be mainly dry. There is a chance
for a few storms to develop shortly before midnight and into the early morning
hours of Saturday. The main threat for rain and severe storms will be outside
our area. This is a very low risk event. The much bigger concern for the weekend
will be Saturday night.

Saturday will be very warm & breezy with wind gusts at 20-30mph. Saturday
evening & night will be our Storm Alert Weather Day period. We've already been
placed under a Level 3 Enhanced risk for severe storms, which means numerous
severe storms are possible. It'll be a line moving from west to east along a
cold front. We could see everything from damaging wind gusts (primary),
tornadoes, and hail. Plus, flooding will become a concern, too. Timing will
likely fluctuate. As of now, 5pm to 1am ET from W to E.

Our highs for Sunday will happen in the early morning hours, and then generally
drop for the rest of the day -- low 50s by lunchtime and 30s by the evening.
Additional rain showers with a secondary system should transition Sunday night
into wintry mix and wet snow. Then, everyone will wake up on Monday morning with
frigid temps in the 20s.

Have a great Friday!
