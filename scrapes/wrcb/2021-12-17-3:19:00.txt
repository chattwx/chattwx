Good morning, scattered showers have moved farther south and east overnight, and
we'll have a few lasting until about 10am. They shouldn't cause any big problems
for your morning commute. The rest of your Friday will again feature above
normal temperatures with highs around 67. Tonight will be mostly cloudy with
lows in the mid-50s.
