Happy Weekend! Today is the last day of Standard Time. Remember to "Spring
Forward" tonight, setting your clocks forward 1 hour to be on Daylight Saving
Time for Sunday.

Now, let's talk weather. Today will be cloudy to mostly cloudy with mild
temperatures. Overall, the day will be dry for your outdoor plans, but there
will be a few showers and times of sprinkles. These will be more likely for our
northern Tennessee counties. As far as temperatures this weekend, both days will
have a large spread of highs from our northern counties to southern ones. On
average, highs today will be in the mid-60s, low 60s to the north, and upper 60s
to 70 to the south. Sunday will be around 73 in Chattanooga, upper 60s to 70 to
the north, and mid-70s to the south. Sunday will be mostly cloudy with some
breaks in the clouds and only a spotty shower chance.

A system will bring more widespread rain with a few thunderstorms on Monday,
especially in the afternoon and evening. Highs will be in the low 60s. Tuesday
will have scattered showers to the south with highs in the mid-60s. Wednesday
will be a warmer day around 70 with rain and storms developing and continuing
into Thursday morning. The rest of Thursday will be partly sunny with highs near
68. Then Friday will have a mix of sun and clouds and cooler only in the
mid-50s.
