GOOD SATURDAY. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF STRAY SHOWERS LINGERING THIS MORNING, BUT
THE THEME FOR THE DAY IS HEAT AND HUMIDITY. WE WILL CLIMB TO A TOASTY HIGH OF
92. THE HEAT INDEX WILL BE IN THE MID-90S. AFTER A FEW SPRINKLES THIS MORNING,
WE WILL POSSIBLY SEE ANOTHER SPRINKLE OR TWO THIS EVENING, BUT THE CHANCE FOR
RAIN IS ONLY 10% TODAY.

SUNDAY WILL BE MUCH THE SAME ONLY HOTTER WITH THE HIGH SOARING TO 94. AGAIN, I
CAN'T PROMISE A POP-UP SHOWER WON'T TAKE PLACE, BUT IT ISN'T LIKELY WITH THE
RAIN CHANCE AGAIN ONLY AT 10%.

AFTER THIS WEEKEND WE WILL TAKE RAIN CHANCES OUT ALTOGETHER EVEN WITH A WEAK
FRONT MOVING THROUGH MONDAY. WE WILL HIT 94 AGAIN MONDAY, BUT THEN WE WILL SEE
THE HUMIDITY AND TEMPS DROPPING JUST A LITTLE.

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WE WILL HOVER IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S WITH THE HUMIDITY
DROPPING, MEANING MUCH SLIGHTLY COMFORTABLE AIR MUCH OF NEXT WEEK.
