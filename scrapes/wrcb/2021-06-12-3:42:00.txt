GOOD AFTERNOON! THE HEAT AND HIGH HUMIDITY ARE BEING FELT ACROSS OUR AREA. THE
TRUE AIR TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOW 90S FOR MOST WITH A MOSTLY
SUNNY SKY. ADD IN THE HUMIDITY, AND THE HEAT INDEX IS IN THE MID-90S. THE
AFTERNOON ISOLATED SHOWERS/STORMS ARE FADING OUT NOW (3:30PM), BUT WE'LL HAVE
ANOTHER ROUND OF SMALL POCKETS OF RAIN FROM ABOUT 6-10PM ET TONIGHT. THEY'LL BE
ISOLATED, SO I WOULD SAY KEEP YOUR PLANS. HOWEVER, REMEMBER WITH SUMMERTIME
SHOWERS/STORMS, YOU CAN GET HEAVY DOWNPOURS, LIGHTNING, AND BRIEF GUSTY WIND.
OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOW 70S.

SUNDAY WILL BE ANOTHER HOT AND HUMID DAY WITH A MIX OF SUN AND CLOUDS. IT'LL BE
DRY DURING THE DAYTIME WITH HIGHS IN THE LOW 90S -- HEAT INDEX NEAR 96. THEN, A
WAVE OF SHOWERS/STORMS WILL MOVE THROUGH FROM THE NORTH DURING THE EVENING
(30%).

MONDAY WILL BE OUR TRANSITION DAY. IT'LL STILL BE HOT WITH HIGHS FROM 90-94, BUT
THE HUMIDITY WILL BE A LITTLE LOWER. THEN, A COLD FRONT WILL PASS ON MONDAY
NIGHT, MEANING TUESDAY WILL BE MUCH NICER -- SUNNY SKIES, MID-80S, AND
COMFORTABLE HUMIDITY LEVELS.
