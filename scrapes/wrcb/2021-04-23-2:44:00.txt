Clouds will continue to roll into the Tennessee Valley tonight and after
midnight as some showers will slide in, too. Late tonight and in the early
morning, there could be some thunderstorms. The Storm Prediction Center has
placed us in a Marginal Risk area for severe storms on Saturday. This is the
lowest level of risk for severe weather. There will be a much better chance for
severe weather south of I-20.

Lows tonight will be near 50 and highs on Saturday will be in the low to mid
60's. It will not be an all-day rain, but on occasion showers and storms will
move through the area and end Saturday night. Sunday will be mostly sunny and
pleasant with highs in the low to mid 70's.

Monday will be sunny with highs near 80. Tuesday will be partly cloudy with
highs in the mid-'80s. Wednesday will see increasing clouds with highs in the
low to mid 80's.

Thursday and Friday have a chance of being wet, but the timing remains a
problem. Right now, I will say scattered showers and storms will be possible
with mild highs. Paul Barys
