Good Wednesday. We continue with our Storm Alert Weather through tonight. Heavy
rain and localized flooding will be likely. FLOOD WATCHES are up for our area
through tomorrow. Some locations could get up to 5" of rain by Thursday evening.
Also this evening we have a small risk of strong storms that could produce
damaging winds and even an isolated tornado can not be completely ruled out. I
would extend that threat into late tonight.

Thursday we will see more sporadic showers but still will have the potential for
those showers to produce heavy rain.

Friday we will still have clouds and a few remnant showers, but the rain will
begin to move out. The high Friday will reach 80.

The weekend is still on track to be warm, but awesome with partly cloudy skies
and highs in the low 80s.
