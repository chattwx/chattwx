Happy Sunday! The last day of your weekend is shaping up to be mainly dry with
just a few downpours developing this afternoon. Plan for the heat because
temperatures will top out in the lower-90s once again. Any shower activity that
pops up will end tonight as lows drop back into the 70s.

In the tropics, Hurricane Ida has strengthened overnight and is now a category 4
hurricane. Landfall will occur later today along the Louisiana coastline.
Impacts from Ida will arrive in the Tennessee Valley late Monday evening and
persist throughout the day on Tuesday. Winds gusts of 25-35 mph will be possible
Tuesday with 40+ mph gusts in our higher elevations. Rainfall totals will
generally range from 2-4" with locally higher amounts in our southwestern
communities. We will also be tracking the potential for a few spin-up tornadoes
Monday night through Tuesday afternoon. Be sure to pay close attention to the
weather as the remnants of Ida move in our direction.

Conditions will begin to improve late Wednesday as the rain showers gradually
come to an end. Thursday through Saturday are shaping up to be gorgeous with
cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Overnight lows may even dip into the
upper-50s by the end of the week!
