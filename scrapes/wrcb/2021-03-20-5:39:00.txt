your Saturday with only a stray cloud. The air will be cool and crisp with highs
around 63 and a light northeast breeze at 5-10mph. Tonight will be mostly clear
with lows in the mid to upper 30s. Watch for possible frost if you've already
planted.

Sunday will be mostly sunny with scattered clouds arriving from the southeast
through the day. It'll be a little warmer in the mid-60s. Another great day to
