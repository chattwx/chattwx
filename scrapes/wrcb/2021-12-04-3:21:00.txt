Happy Saturday! It has been another mild December day with high temperatures
topping out near 70 degrees. Skies will remain cloudy into the overnight hours
with any rain chances remaining to our west. Lows tonight will range from 48-53
degrees.

Skies will remain mostly cloudy on Sunday with temperatures a few degrees
colder. A few light showers will be around after 5 PM with a better chance of
showers Sunday night.

A more active pattern will settle in next week. Showers will develop Monday
morning along a cold front before tapering during the late afternoon hours.
Colder temperatures will settle in behind the front Tuesday as highs struggle to
push out of the upper-40s. Another round of showers will be possible late
Tuesday into Wednesday as another storm system brings moisture into the area.

Thursday and Friday will remain mostly cloudy, with a few showers possible
Friday afternoon. Temperatures will return to the mid-60s by Friday afternoon.
