The widespread rain from overnight will end for our far southeastern counties by
about 9am. Then, expect a mostly cloudy sky for Sunday with a few times of
showers. The most likely period of scattered showers will be this afternoon into
evening as a cold front passes. Highs today will be slightly above normal in the
mid to upper 50s with wind from the south. Once the front passes, wind will
shift out of the west and northwest as much colder air moves in.

Monday will be cold with temperatures remaining in the 30s and a NW wind at
10-15mph. We'll also have times of snowfall, starting in the early morning hours
and continuing all the way into Monday night. Snow showers are expected in the
higher elevations with accumulations of 0.5-2" and then mainly flurries in
valley locations (a little more in valley spots of McMinn and Rhea Counties). 

Clouds will break and clear on Tuesday with highs in the low 40s. Wednesday will
have lots of sunshine in the upper 40s to 50. Thursday will be partly sunny to
mostly cloudy and around 54. Friday looks to be rainy with showers possibly
continuing into Saturday.
