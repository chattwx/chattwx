It's a warm afternoon with light winds, and with plenty of sun. Highs will warm
~5 above normal near 80 today. This warming trend will continue through
Thursday.

It will be clear tonight and comfortable to watch for the Full Pink Moon. This
month's full moon is also a Supermoon. Two Supermoons occur this year, and the
next one occurs just next month.

Through Friday morning, temperatures will be quite temperate in the mid 50s to
low 60s. This also makes the next several days, a good time to get veggie seeds
and seedlings in the ground.

Next rain chance: Thursday evening through Friday morning. Preliminary rainfall
of 0.50" to 0.75" is looking possible at this time.
