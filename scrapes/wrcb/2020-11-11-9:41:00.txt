A cold front will slowly work it's way into the Tennessee Valley tonight.
Showers will be ongoing for Hamilton, Bradley, Sequatchie, Bledsoe through 3PM
or so. Those east of I-75 could still have rain through 7PM-8PM tonight. A
thunderstorm or two can't be ruled out today either.

So far, many locations including Marion, Hamilton, Sequatchie, and Bledsoe
counties, have picked up 0.50" to 0.75" so far.

Ponding on the roads, due to the slow moving nature of this front, will be
possible today.

Dry air returns Thursday. It will be in the upper 50s for the morning commute
tomorrow, however, feeling cooler thanks to dry air on the move. Jackets and
coats will be needed by Friday morning, as lows will be near normal for mid
November in the mid to upper 40s by the end of the week.

TODAY:

12PM: Rain Showers, 72

3PM: Rain Showers, 73

6PM: Rain ongoing east of I-75, 69
