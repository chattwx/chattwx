Well the heat is on this week.

Besides a stray shower today and Tuesday, the pattern is shaping up rain-free
for most for the next week, too!

It will be warm in the afternoon through Wednesday with highs near normal in the
low 80s.

By Thursday and into the upcoming weekend, temperatures soar to the 90s. It's
looking likely the first 90 degree high will occur by weeks end.

For the upcoming weekend, too, it looks like we'll be flirting with near the
record highs. Saturday the 22nd, the record high is 96 from 1941, and on the
23rd the record high is 93 from 1953.

TODAY:

6AM: M. Clear, 55

12PM: Few Clouds, 75

3PM: Warm. P. Sunny, 80
