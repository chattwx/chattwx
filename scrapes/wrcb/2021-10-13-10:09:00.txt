Low temperatures will range from 61-65 degrees tonight under partly cloudy
skies. Patchy dense fog will develop late tonight into your Thursday morning
commute. Remember to give yourself a little extra time tomorrow morning!

After the fog clears tomorrow morning, skies will feature a mix of sun and
clouds. High temperatures will top out in the lower-80s which is about 5-7
degrees above average for this time of the year.

A strong cold front will be approaching the area throughout the day on Friday,
spreading clouds across the area during the afternoon hours. Temperatures will
still reach the lower-80s, but Friday will be the last time we have 80 degree
temperatures for a while. As the cold front pushes across the area, scattered
showers will break out Friday night into Saturday morning. Rainfall amounts will
generally remain on the light side, but temperatures will drop sharply during
the day on Saturday. We will only reach the 60s Saturday afternoon before
falling into the 40s Saturday night. Hello Fall!
