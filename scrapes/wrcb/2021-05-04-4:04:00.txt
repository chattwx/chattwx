Good Tuesday afternoon. We will continue to see some scattered showers and
storms through about 11pm, then clear out through the overnight. We have already
seen about 1"-3" of rain, and may get another 1/4" or so before all is said and
done. We do have some Flash Flood Watches in effect for our north GA counties
until 2AM. Storms tonight may produce some strong to damaging winds so remain
weather aware this evening.

Wednesday will be awesome with clearing skies and temps ranging from 64 to 73.

Thursday and Friday look good overall with cooler mornings around 50 degrees.
Afternoon highs will hover right around 70 degrees. We may get a sprinkle or two
Thursday evening, and then again early Friday morning.

The weekend looks good overall. Saturday we will range from 50 to 70 with a
sun/cloud mix. Sunday will be a little warmer from 56 to 78. We may get some
showers Sunday evening also.
