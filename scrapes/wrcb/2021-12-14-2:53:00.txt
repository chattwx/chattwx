Good Tuesday. We will rapidly cool down after sunset with temps in the 40s much
of the evening. Overnight we will cool down to the mid to upper 30s. Temps,
overall, will be a few degrees above yesterday morning, but chilly nonetheless.

As a front stalls to our west, temps will do nothing but rise.

Wednesday we will hit 64 with plenty of sunshine. We will make it to 66 Thursday
with a slight chance for a shower on the plateau. We will even go to 71 Friday!
The record Friday is 73 set in 1984.

The front finally breaks through Saturday and will deliver showers on and off
through the day accumulating 1/4" to 1/2" of rain through the day. No severe
weather will hit, and we may not get more than a rumble or two of thunder. Temps
will be in the 60s all day Saturday.

Cool dry air moves back in Sunday with temps ranging from 35 in the morning to
54 in the afternoon.
