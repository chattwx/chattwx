Happy Saturday! It will be a chilly start to your weekend as we wake up to
temperatures in the 40s. Areas of patchy fog will be possible before 9 AM,
primarily along the Plateau and river valleys. This afternoon will be fantastic
as highs range from 67-72 degrees under mostly sunny skies.

A warm front will lift to our north Sunday, allowing temperatures to warm back
into the upper-70s. Cloud cover will increase during the afternoon, but any rain
chances will stay well north of the Tennessee Valley.

Our next chance of rain comes Monday as a cold front approaches from the west.
The current timing of scattered showers will be Monday morning through the early
evening hours. Rainfall amounts will be light. 

Conditions will clear for Tuesday as temperatures turn cooler with highs in the
mid-60s. Quiet conditions will be short-lived as a low-pressure system arrives
late Wednesday. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will be possible from late
Wednesday through Friday afternoon. The timing of this system could change so
continue to check back for updates.
