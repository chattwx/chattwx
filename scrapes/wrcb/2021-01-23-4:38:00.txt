Today will be a great day for outdoor plans with lots of blue sky and sunshine.
It'll be cold in the morning, warming up to afternoon highs in the low 50s. Some
clouds will move in tonight with lows from 30-35. Sunday will have increasing
clouds, but mainly dry during the daytime except for a few spots of sprinkles
and light showers - highs around 51. 

Sunday night into Monday morning widespread rain will move into our area. It'll
be moderate to heavy at times. The heaviest should be done by about 8am. Then,
through the day on Monday, there will be on and off scattered showers with one
more band of rain on Monday night. This night rain will be the time when a
thunderstorm will be most likely. Monday will be warm in the mid-60s.

Any rain/storms will wrap up before sunrise on Tuesday morning. The rest of the
day will be mostly sunny, reaching the mid-60s again. Wednesday will be partly
sunny with scattered showers and highs in the upper 50s to 60. Thursday will
have an isolated shower chance and highs in the low 50s.
