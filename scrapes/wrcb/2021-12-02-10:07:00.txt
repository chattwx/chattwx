Happy Thursday, everyone! This afternoon will feature pleasant weather
conditions. We're expecting mostly sunny skies and well above average temps.
Highs later today will likely be around 70 degrees!

Friday will feature even more sunshine, and likely the warmest temps of the
week. Highs will likely warm past the 70 degree mark.

Small changes arrive this weekend with increasing cloud cover, an isolated
sprinkle or two, and slightly cooler temps. Highs will be in the 60s with
morning lows in the mid to upper 40s.

A more active weather pattern still looks to develop next week with a few
systems bringing some rain chances back to the region. The first arrives with
scattered showers on Monday, but a stronger system could provide some beneficial
rainfall by next Wednesday & Thursday!

High temps will likely trend closer to average for next week.
