Good morning and happy Friday! Today will be partly sunny to mostly cloudy with
highs in the mid to upper 80s - 88 in Chattanooga. The humidity will be slightly
greater today. Still not super sticky and overwhelming, but it's enough that you
may notice a difference compared to earlier this week. There will be a few
isolated showers popping up mid-afternoon through the evening along the higher
elevations, primarily the Cumberland Plateau. Overnight lows will range from
65-70.

Saturday will be partly sunny with scattered showers and storms (50%). It
certainly won't be a washout if you're doing one last summertime thing with the
family or going to the World's Longest Yard Sale. Just be aware that you may
need to rush inside if a storm develops. Highs will be in the upper 80s.

Sunday will be mostly sunny and hot with highs in the low 90s. The heat will
continue on Monday in the low 90s, and the summertime humidity will be back with
heat index values in the mid-90s. Then, for the rest of the week, each day will
be around 90 with chances for scattered showers and storms.
