TODAY:

It has hit 90° in Chattanooga over the last 3 days. It will hit 90° today as
showers develop this afternoon and evening. Expect much less coverage than
Tuesday. A few showers are possible in the higher elevations from 4PM to 9PM -
mainly for the Blue Ridge, Ellijay, Murphy and those east of I-75.

TOMORROW:

Thursday will be hot and very humid! Dew points will rise to the 70s for
everyone tomorrow. It will really be a "wear the air" kind of day. Then rain
heads in Thursday night.

While there is not a risk for severe weather Thursday night-Friday morning,
heavy rain will be possible for the morning commute on Friday. Plan on needing
umbrellas Friday morning and heading into the office a tad earlier.

GOOD NEWS:

This front will be moving out Friday evening, setting up a fantastic weekend for
the 4th of July. Saturday and Sunday mornings look more promising in the low
60s, and with low humidity! The humidity looks to rise back up on Monday, but
staying rain-free.
