Good morning, today will begin with areas of patchy fog, primarily in river
valleys, lasting until about 9-10am. Friday morning should remain dry with a
mostly cloudy sky and temperatures in the 70s. Once again, we'll have scattered
showers today, possibly a few storms. Most will happen between 12 and 7pm ET. It
will be mostly cloudy to at times partly sunny later in the day with highs
around 80. Showers should wrap up for pleasant Friday Night Football games in
the 70s. Overnight lows will range from 65-70.

Rain and storm chances continue to rise for the weekend, so now is a good time
to have a backup plan for outdoor activities. It won't rain all day or in every
location, but plan ahead in case it does. Saturday morning generally looks quiet
with showers and storms building up for the afternoon. Sunday will have rain in
both the AM and PM. Weekend highs will be near 80. The active pattern will
continue for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Finally, a strong front will pass
on Wednesday, leading to beautiful weather on Thursday with low humidity, sunny
skies, and highs in the mid-70s.
