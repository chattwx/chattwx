Sunday is starting off with widespread dense fog across much of the viewing
area. Please, allow yourself some extra time driving this morning as visibility
may quickly drop to a quarter mile or less. The dense fog will last until about
9AM EST. The rest of the daylight hours today will be nice, becoming mostly
sunny this afternoon with highs around 60. 

Clouds will then increase again this evening with rain showers arriving around
8PM. Rain will then be heavy overnight, totaling 1-1.5", with the heaviest rain
from about 11PM to 5AM. An isolated rumble of thunder can't be ruled out along
with brief gusty winds, but this is primarily a rain event. As colder air wraps
around, a little wintry mix/snow in the higher elevations will be possible from
about 7-10AM EST, especially in Grundy, Sequatchie, and Bledsoe Counties. Monday
will be cooler staying in the 40s to 50 with a dry afternoon and clouds breaking
slightly. Tuesday will be mostly sunny with highs in the low 50s. Wednesday will
have showers again and cool around 48. We'll watch once again for a little
wintry mix in the higher elevations. Thursday will be partly cloudy with highs
only in the mid-40s. Friday will have lots of sunshine and highs in the upper
40s to 50.
