Today will continue the high heat, muggy air, and afternoon and evening storms.
Tuesday will begin with a little bit of patchy fog and mostly sunny skies.
Temperatures will be comfortable for "First Day of School" pictures outside this
morning, warming to mid-80s by noon and then highs in the upper 80s to low 90s.
It'll be very humid, so the heat index will be topping out near 99. Once again,
we'll have hit and miss storms developing in the afternoon through the evening.
It'll be similar to what we experienced yesterday (and multiple times this
summer) with heavy rain and lightning. A few storms may become strong to severe
with damaging wind gusts and small hail. We're not doing a Storm Alert Weather
Day today due to the disorganized nature and low threat, but keep in mind a
couple of Significant Weather Advisories or a base Severe Thunderstorm Warning
will be possible if you have after school outdoor plans.

This summertime pattern will last all week. Wednesday through Friday will have
highs in the low 90s, heat index around 100, and scattered PM storms. Showers
and storms are looking likely for Saturday and Sunday, too, with highs dropping
to the 80s by Sunday.
