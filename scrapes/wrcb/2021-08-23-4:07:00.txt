There are several areas of dense fog this Monday morning, primarily near river
valleys. If your path to work or school takes you along a road that typically
fogs, it's probably foggy this morning. The fog will last through about 9am, and
then the rest of the day, we'll have sunny skies. Today will be hot and humid
with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s, heat index values in the mid-90s.
Tonight will be clear with only a few stray clouds and lows in the upper 60s to
low 70s.

Tuesday will be mostly sunny with even more spots reaching the low 90s - 94 in
Chattanooga. Heat index values topping out in the upper 90s. The heat will
persist on Wednesday in the low 90s, but we'll add back in rain chances. A
scattered showers/storms will be possible, moving from east to west. Thursday
will be in the upper 80s and partly sunny with scattered showers/storms. Friday
will be in the upper 80s to 90 with only an isolated shower chance under a
mostly sunny sky. Then, scattered storms will be possible over the weekend.
