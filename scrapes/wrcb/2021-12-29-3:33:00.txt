Today is a Storm Alert Weather Day, specifically for tonight, but first we have
to get through this morning. Heavy rain and storms are moving northeast across
our area and will exit by about 9am. Watch for standing water on roads for your
morning commute.We'll then enter a slight break period until the early afternoon
with only spotty rain/storm chances. 

By mid-afternoon scattered storms will start up again. Coverage and energy for
those will increase into the evening. The window for strong to severe storms
unfortunately is a long one with today's setup. Ingredients will be favorable
for an extended period of time with no sharp storm line, so stay alert and
prepared. 

KEY TIMING: Most likely window 7pm-3am ET -- Broad window 5pm-6am ET (Wed night
til Thu before sunrise). MOVEMENT: Generally W to E in clusters. THREATS:
Scattered severe storms possible (Level 2 out of 5) - damaging wind, hail, and
tornadoes. Localized flooding. For many, this will be an overnight event while
you're asleep, so please make sure you have alerts that will wake you up.

Rain will end Thursday morning by about 10am, and then improving conditions with
a partly sunny sky in the afternoon and highs in the low 70s. Friday will have
more scattered showers. Then, our next big event day will be Saturday. Saturday
PM will have the risk for severe weather associated with a cold front, and then
temps dramatically dropping through Sunday.
