Happy Thursday! Peeks of sunshine are beginning to break out across the
Tennessee Valley, allowing temperatures to reach the lower-80s this afternoon.
Scattered showers and storms will develop later this afternoon, primarily
between 3-8 PM. The best chance of rain for today will be in our northern
Georgia and Alabama communities. We will stay dry tonight as low temperatures
drop into the upper-60s.

Rain chances are trending higher Friday through Sunday as Gulf moisture
continues to surge northward. The best chance of showers and storms will be
during each afternoon and evening. Localized flooding will be possible with some
of the heavier storms. Increased rain chances will keep temperatures fairly cool
each day, ranging from 77-81 degrees.

Daily rain chances will carry over into next week, keeping temperatures cooler
than average. We are currently monitoring the potential for a cold front passage
during the middle of next week, which could bring another period of fall-like
weather to the Tennessee Valley.
