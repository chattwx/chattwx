Skies will remain partly cloudy tonight as lows range from 66-70 degrees.

Monday will likely be our hottest day of the week as many locations climb into
the lower 90s. Rain chances will be low, but a stray shower or two will be
possible during the afternoon and evening.

Rain chances will increase throughout the rest of the week. The highest coverage
of rain looks to be Thursday and Friday. As rain chances increase, temperatures
will turn slightly cooler by the end of the week. Scattered afternoon showers
and storms will continue into your Fourth of July weekend.
