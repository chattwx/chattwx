The weather story today is the mild temperature and winds! Winds will be gusting
to 30 mph by 5PM-7PM or so, continuing overnight.

The High Wind Warning has replaced the High Wind Watch for Monroe county,
beginning today at 4PM and continuing through Noon on Thursday. The Warning
means sustained winds of 25-40 mph will be possible with higher gusts to 80 mph!
This is an upgrade from yesterday.

A Winter Storm Watch will be valid beginning at 4PM tomorrow until 4AM Friday
morning for Blount Smoky Mountains, Cocke, and Sevier county where 2" to 4" of
snow will be possible.

Timing is still on track for rain to arrive tonight and increase tomorrow
morning, where heavy rain will be ongoing. The wintry mix is still possible by
afternoon, with light snow showers in the afternoon and again overnight into
Christmas morning. Accumulation amounts will be light. If any moisture is still
on the roads on Christmas Eve-black ice would be the next concern for Christmas
morning, Friday.

Here are my thoughts for snowfall:

East Polk, up to 1"

East Monroe, 2" to 4"

northern Fannin, 1/2" to 1"

Sequatchie, Blesdoe, Grundy, north Hamilton, Bradley, dusting to 1/2"

TODAY:

12PM: 51, High Clouds

3PM: 58, Increasing Clouds

6PM: 53, M. Cloudy
