Good Wednesday. You will need a layer or two on this evening with clear skies
and temps dropping quickly through the 40s into the 30s.

Thursday will warm to 59 under partly cloudy skies with breezes picking up a
little from the northwest in the afternoon.

Friday we will see overcast skies with a few spotty showers on and off and even
a stray thunderstorm or two Friday evening.

A front will bring in some areas of heavy rain and spotty thunderstorms Saturday
morning into early afternoon. After 2pm, temps will begin falling as we dry out,
and colder air filters in. Rainfall amounts will be around 1/2" up to 2". Winds
will be gusty at times through the day.

Sunday will be colder and dry with temps ranging from 34 in the morning to an
afternoon high of only 53.

Next week will be dry with slowly warming temps through the week.
