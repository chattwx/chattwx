Scattered showers and storms will continue into the late evening hours as
temperatures hold steady in the mid-80s. Severe storms will be possible with
gusty winds, hail, and frequent lightning. Some of the heavier storms could also
lead to areas of flash flooding. The stormy weather will continue into the
overnight hours. Lows will drop into the lower-70s.

Monday will feature a very similar weather pattern with showers and storms
developing during the afternoon hours. Highs will top out in the mid-80s.

Tuesday and Wednesday will likely be our wettest days of the upcoming week as
the remnants of Fred track into the Tennessee Valley. Periods of rain and
thunderstorms will lead to flash flooding concerns, especially in southwestern
North Carolina and northern Georgia. 1-3" of rainfall is expected with locally
higher amounts east of the I-75 corridor.
