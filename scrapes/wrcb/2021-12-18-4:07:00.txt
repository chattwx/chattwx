Happy Saturday! On and off rain showers will be around for much of Saturday
ahead of an approaching cold front. The rain could be heavy at times with total
rainfall amounts of up to an inch possible through this evening. A few rumbles
of thunder will be possible, but any severe threat will stay well to our south.
Temperatures will run about 15 degrees above average today as highs range from
67-71 degrees.

The rain will gradually taper off tonight as the cold front pushes to our east.
It will feel more like December on Sunday as colder air settles back into the
region. Daytime highs will return to the lower-50s with temperatures dropping
into the 30s Sunday night into Monday morning.

We will take a break from the December warmth Monday through Thursday as
temperatures remain seasonable. Highs will top out in the 50s each afternoon
with overnight lows dropping into the 30s during the overnight hours.

Next Friday is Christmas Eve, and it looks like it will be a warm one as highs
return to the 60s. The warmth will likely carry over into Christmas Day as the
latest forecast models suggest highs will top out in the mid-60s. No white
Christmas this year!
