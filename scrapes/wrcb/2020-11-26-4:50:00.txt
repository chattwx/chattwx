Happy Thanksgiving! We are off to a foggy and warm start this morning. This
afternoon will be sunny and warm in the mid to upper 60s. We will be much cooler
tonight as we drop to about 40 under clear skies.

Friday and Saturday look great. We will be sunny with a high of 68 Friday and
cooling to 62 Saturday.

Sunday low pressure will move in bringing in rain showers Sunday afternoon into
Sunday night. Sunday's high will only be about 60.

Monday lingering rain showers will hang around until mid-morning. In all, we
will get about 1/2" to 1" of rain Sunday into Monday. We will start out in the
low to mid-40s, but cold air will rapidly move in as the rain tapers off in the
valley. In the higher elevations, we could see some light snow showers Monday
afternoon.

Tuesday will be bitterly cold with temps ranging from 28 in the morning to only
43 in the afternoon. We may see some lingering mountain snow showers Tuesday.
