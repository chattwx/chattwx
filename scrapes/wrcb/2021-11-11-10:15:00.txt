Happy Thursday, everyone! It's been a mostly cloudy but mainly dry morning
across the Tennessee Valley. Things will be changing as we move into the
afternoon hours. 

Look for mostly cloudy skies this afternoon with temperatures warming into the
upper 60s to lower 70s. A cold front approaches from the west bringing
increasing rain chances from west to east between 3pm-9pm. 

This band of rain moving through could have a few embedded rumbles of thunder,
but widespread severe weather is expected.

Behind the rain, skies will actually be clearing overnight, leading to a bit of
patchy morning fog.

Friday will actually be a decent day with mostly sunny skies but temperatures
will be about 10 degrees cooler. Highs will only be in the lower 60s. 

A second dry front moves through the area Friday night ushering in another shot
of colder air. This will set us up for a dry but cold weekend. 

High temps will struggle to reach the lower 50s, and overnight lows will drop
down into the 30s.

One more blast of cold air arrives with a third front Sunday night into Monday,
leading to a few more chilly days to start next week.
