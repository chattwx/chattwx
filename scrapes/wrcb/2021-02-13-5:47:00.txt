Winter Weather Advisories are in effect for Marion, Sequatchie, Bledsoe, Grundy,
Van Buren, and Jackson Counties this morning for freezing rain/drizzle and
freezing fog. It may look like rain coming down, but it'll freeze when it makes
contact with a surface. A glaze of ice will be possible. Please, watch out for
slick conditions, particularly on elevated surfaces: porches, steps, overpasses,
and bridges. Even a few roads and sidewalks may be slippery/icy this morning,
especially in Grundy County. If you can stay at home until about 10am CST, that
would be safest. Additionally, there is a little bit of mix and freezing drizzle
in other mountain locations in the area. Please, use caution.

Most places are only dealing with light rain and drizzle. Precipitation will
mostly wrap up by about 1pm EST today. The afternoon will be cool from 40-45 for
most with only a spotty sprinkle chance and cloudy skies. Tonight will remain
overcast with lows in the mid-30s. Valentine's Day on Sunday will be cloudy with
highs near 44. A few late afternoon and evening isolated showers will be
possible with rain and western freezing drizzle increasing after midnight for
early Monday morning.

Monday morning won't have much activity, but we'll be watching Monday afternoon
into Tuesday morning for a bigger system to move across the area. It'll bring
rain for most, but Grundy County is under a Winter Storm Watch for the
possibility of freezing rain again and wintry mix. Highs on both Monday and
Tuesday will be in the 40s.
