Happy Tuesday! Skies will remain mostly cloudy for the remainder of the day as a
cold front approaches the area. Moisture will be at a minimum along this front,
but a few light showers will be possible through the early evening hours. Skies
will begin to clear tonight as lows fall into the mid-60s. Patchy fog will
develop after 3 AM which will lead to reduced visibility for your Wednesday
morning commute.

Wednesday and Thursday will be dry with skies ranging from mostly sunny to
partly cloudy. Temperatures will be about 5-7 degrees above average as highs top
out in the low to mid-80s.

Friday is when things begin to change across the Tennessee Valley. Temperatures
will still reach the 80s Friday afternoon, but a strong cold front will be
approaching from the west throughout the day. Cloud cover will increase by
Friday evening with scattered showers breaking out during the overnight hours.
Rain chances will continue for the first part of your Saturday, but the big
story will be the arrival of fall-like air! Temperatures will fall into the 60s
by Saturday evening with overnight lows dipping into the 40s by Saturday night.
Sweater weather is almost here!
