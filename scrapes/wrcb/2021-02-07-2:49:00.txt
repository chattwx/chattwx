Clouds will continue clear for Sunday evening, lasting the longest over the
Cumberland Plateau. Eventually, it'll be a mostly clear night with lows from
25-30 for most. Due to this morning's snow, please be mindful driving overnight,
especially in Grundy, Bledsoe, Sequatchie, and Van Buren Counties where the most
snow fell. If a road looks wet, it may be black ice. Any snow slush leftover
from today on secondary roads will refreeze tonight.

Monday will be very cold in the morning but warm up nicely to the mid-50s for
the afternoon with a mostly sunny sky. Tuesday and Wednesday will be mild around
60 with more clouds and a small chance for a light, isolated shower. Greater
rain will arrive for Thursday, lasting until Friday morning. Thursday's highs in
the mid-50s, and then Friday around 50. 

Then, for next weekend, we may have really cold temperatures. One long-term
model finally has the very cold arctic air dropping south into our region, while
a couple of others have us a little bit below normal. For now, I'm going with
the latter with highs in the low to mid-40s and lows in the 20s. We'll keep you
updated.
