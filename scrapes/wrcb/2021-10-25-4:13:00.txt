Good morning, today is a Storm Alert Weather Day as we expect a broken line of
storms to move across our area from west to east from about 9am to 3pm ET. These
showers and storms for most locations will simply be a nuisance. However, there
is a low-end chance for an isolated storm to strengthen and produce 40-60mph
wind gusts. This threat is primarily focused on our northeastern communities
from Dayton, TN to Blue Ridge, GA and northeast. Therefore, if you work outside
or you are a midday commuter, stay aware of the weather conditions. Rainfall
totals will generally be light at 0.1-0.2" with higher amounts possible in
thunderstorms. Some locations, especially in GA, may end up with no rain. Today
will remain warm with highs in the low to mid-70s. A cold front will pass our
area at about 8pm tonight with lows dropping into the mid to upper 40s.

Tuesday will be cooler with highs near 65 and decreasing clouds and sunshine.
Wednesday will have a layer of high thin clouds with highs in the upper 60s.
Then, we will enter an unsettled pattern with rain on Thursday and Friday and
much cooler highs in the low 60s and mid-50s, respectively.
